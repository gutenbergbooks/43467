<h3>The Beginning of Modern Music</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Descent of the Roman Chant from the kithara songs of the
Romans and thence from those of the Greeks&mdash;First
appearance of modern melody&mdash;Steps toward the formation
of a musical system&mdash;Ambrosian and Gregorian
chants&mdash;Their character&mdash;Nokter Balbulus and sequences&mdash;Spread

music at this period.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">IN reading any history of the development
of music as an art one must ever bear in
mind the fact that music was also developing
at the same time as a popular mode of expression,
and that the two processes were
separate. The cultivation of modern music
as an art was begun by the medieval priests
of the Roman Catholic Church, who were
endeavoring to arrange a liturgy for their
service, and it is due to this fact that for
several centuries the only artistic music was
that of the Church, and that it was controlled
by influences which barely touched
the popular songs of the times. In the
course of years the two kinds of music came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
together, and important changes were made.
But any account of the development of
modern music as an art is compelled to
begin with the story of the medieval chant.</p>

<p>In the beginning the chants of the Christian
Church, from which the medieval chant
was developed, were without system. They
were a heterogeneous mass of music derived
wholly from sources which chanced to be
near at hand. The early Christians in Judea
must naturally have borrowed their music
from the worship of their forefathers, who
were mostly Jews. The Christians in Greece
naturally adapted Greek music to their requirements,
while those in Rome made use
of the Roman kithara (lyre) songs, which in
their turn were borrowed from the Greeks.
Christ and the apostles at the Last Supper
chanted one of the old Hebrew psalms.
Saint Paul speaks also of "hymns and
spiritual songs," by one of which designations
he certainly means the hymns of the
early Christians founded on Roman lyre
songs. It is also on record that the Christian
communities of Alexandria as early as
180 <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span> were in the habit of repeating the
chant of the Last Supper with an accompaniment
of flutes, and Pliny, the Younger (62-110
<span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>), describes the custom of singing
hymns to the glory of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The psalms in the early Church were
chanted antiphonally; that is, one verse was
sung by one part of the congregation and
answered by another with the next verse, or
they were chanted by priest and congregation
alternately. Of course there could not have
been any high artistic endeavor in such
music, because it must have been within
the capacity of the least skilled performers.
There could not have been any fixed system
in the Church until its various branches in
the vast Roman empire were unified under a
Christian emperor, Constantine (306-337
<span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>). Under him art and architecture
began to serve the Church, and it is about
this time that we begin to discover attempts
at the formation of a system in church music.
Four distinct steps are traceable:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3 small"><i>First.</i> <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span> 314.&mdash;Pope Sylvester founded
singing-schools at Rome.<br />

<i>Second.</i> <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span> 350.&mdash;Flavian and Diodorus
made antiphonal chanting of the psalms a required
part of the church service at Antioch.<br />

<i>Third.</i> <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span> 367.&mdash;The Council of Laodicea
forbade congregational singing, and confined
the service to a trained choir.<br />

<i>Fourth.</i> <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span> 384 (about).&mdash;St. Ambrose
brought together the inharmonious elements in the
church liturgy and formulated a general system of
chanting known as the Ambrosian chant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
The foundation of singing-schools produced
choristers who were able to meet the
requirements of the improved music, for that
was beyond the narrow powers of the early
congregations. The reader will readily see
how the first three steps toward the formation
of a system were logical. But differences
in practice naturally crept in, and the
work of Ambrose appears to have been one
of regulation. He founded his system on
four of the ancient Greek scales, which were,
of course, at the base of all the Greek and
Roman tunes then used in the Church. It is
unnecessary to go into any extended account
of Greek music in order to get an idea of the
character of the Ambrosian chant, but it is
needful to give the subject some consideration,
because Greek music influenced modern
music for several centuries. All modern
major scales are formed thus: two whole
intervals followed by one-half interval (a
semitone), then three whole intervals followed
by a half. For example, take the
scales of C and G:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music010a.mid">Listen: C Scale</a></div>

<p class="center small smcap">[G scale: 1 2 ½ 1 2 3 ½]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
The Greek scales were formed on a wholly
different principle. The foundation of the
system was the tetrachord, which always
contained, as its name implies, four notes.
Between some two of these there was always
a half-interval, and the scale was named
according to the position of that semitone.
The Doric scale had the semitone at the
beginning of each tetrachord, the Phrygian
in the middle, and the Lydian at the top,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music011a.mid">Listen: Doric</a><span class="i2">&nbsp;</span><a href="music/music011b.mid">Listen: Phrygian</a><span class="i2">&nbsp;</span><a href="music/music011c.mid">Listen: Lydian</a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/music011.png" width="400" height="274" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/music011x.png">View Larger Image Here.</a></div>
</div>

<p class="poetry2 small smcap">Doric.    [½ 1 2 3 ½ 1 2 3]<br />
Phrygian. [1 ½ 1 2 3 ½ 1 2]<br />
Lydian.   [1 2 ½ 1 2 3 ½ 1]</p>

<p>The reader will understand that every scale
was divided into two tetrachords, each having
its semitone in the same position. There
were, of course, several other scales, but
these are sufficient to illustrate the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The peculiarity of the sound of chants
founded on these ancient scales to our modern
ears is what we call the "lack of tonality."
Our scales are all determined by the semitone
between the seventh and eighth notes,
called the leading note. The scale of G, for
instance, cannot exist without the F sharp.
Our ears have been trained to expect that
progression, and so these old Greek scales do
not seem to us to be in any key at all, and
when we wish to describe a tune that has
apparently no beginning, end, or rhythm, we
say it sounds like a chant. For several centuries
all modern music written by the scientific
composers suffered from this lack of
tonality, while much of the popular music of
the people was written in the modern major
and minor keys. Any musician will see
that the old Lydian scale was our scale of C
major. The ancient Æolian scale was almost
the same as our scale of A minor. From
these two our modern scales developed themselves
among the people who were not busy
trying to build church liturgies out of Greek
music.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the musical
character of the Ambrosian chant except that
contemporary writers regarded it as very sweet
and solemn. One important fact has come
down to us, namely, that the Ambrosian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
chant was metrical. This means that it followed
the prosodial quantity of the syllables
in the Latin text of the liturgy. A long syllable
had a long note, and a short syllable a
short note. From this peculiarity the chant
obtained the name of <i>cantus firmus</i>, or fixed
chant. It was, however, speedily merged in
what is called the Gregorian chant. This has
generally been attributed to Pope Gregory
(590-604 <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>); but recent investigations
go to prove that he did little beyond issuing
rules as to its use and for its regulation. The
church chant, however, was changed in character
in the time of Gregory, and one of the
most fruitful alterations was the abandonment
of its metrical character. The tones no longer
had a determined length; and this abolished
from the church music of the time the last
vestige of rhythm. It furthermore left the
singers free to do as they pleased, and so gave
rise to abuses which seemed to be injurious
to music, but which really led to good results,
as we shall see. In form, the Gregorian chant
was divided into five parts: the "intonation,"
which was the introductory phrase of
the first half of the verse; the "recitation"
of the principal part of that half on a single
note; the "mediation," which finished the
first half of the verse and formed the connecting
link between it and the second half; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
"recitation," which began the second half;
and the "termination," which ended the
verse.</p>

<p>Gregory arranged the mass in its present
form, and prescribed a special introit for each
psalm, and probably one for each division
of the mass. The famous old anonymous
hymns, the Te Deum, Magnificat, Benedictus,
etc., had taken their place in the church
service in its very earliest days; and the mass
had gradually been formed by selection and
arrangement of these. Another form which
gradually grew up in the Church was the
Sequence. This had its origin in a desire to
allow the congregation more opportunity to
take part in the musical service. In their
oldest and purest form these sequences consisted
of ornamental passages intoned on a
single vowel,&mdash;as the final "a" of "jubila."
These sequences illustrate in a striking manner
that freedom from control of text which
came so conspicuously into music in Gregory's
time. This freedom, while it led to abuses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of the church ritual, gave music a certain
amount of independence as an art, and enabled
it to develop more rapidly than it could
have done had it been tied fast to the text.
Nokter Balbulus, a monk of the famous convent
of St. Gall, Switzerland, is said to have
popularized the sequences in the ninth century
by writing thirty-five special ones. Some
of these are still used in the Roman Church.
The convent of St. Gall, to which Nokter
belonged, was a famous centre of musical
culture in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries.
The writing of special words for sequences
was followed by others than Nokter;
and in the end these reduced themselves to
these five well-known texts: Dies Iræ, Stabat
Mater, Victimæ Paschali, Veni Sancte Spiritus,
and Lauda Sion.</p>

<p>The Roman chant soon spread through
Europe. The successor of Gregory was
acknowledged by the Western nations as the
Supreme Head of the united Church, and
this, of course, tended to a general use of the
same ritual. In 604 Roman singers were
sent to England, and in 660 monks went to
teach the Gregorian chant in Brittany. Paris
had become the capital of France not long
before that, and the Gallic service was now
remodelled on that of Rome. The Roman
ritual was introduced into Germany by Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Boniface in 744, and it was probably made
known at St. Gall about the same time.
Charlemagne, in the eighth century, founded
schools of music on Gregory's plan at Dijon,
Cambray, Lyons, Orléans, and other French
cities, and also at Regensburg, Würzburg,
Mainz, and other German places.</p>

<p>The general introduction of the Gregorian
chant established the melodic basis of modern
music. It will be well for the reader to bear
in mind that the three elementary constituents
of music are melody, harmony, and
rhythm. Melody is produced by the successive
sounding of single tones of different
pitch. Harmony is produced by the simultaneous
sounding of single notes of different
pitch. When those notes are united according
to rule we call the result a chord. Rhythm
is the regular recurrence of long and short
beats. Now, if the reader has comprehended
the account given of the early Roman chant,
he will perceive that it embodied only one
of the elements of music, namely, melody.
There was no harmony, because everything
was sung in one part. It was simply a plain
chant; and when the organ first came into
use to accompany it, the instrument played
the same succession of single notes as the
voices sang. This fact must be kept clearly
in mind in order to understand the next steps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in the development of modern music. In
the beginning there was only melody; and
that was like the earth before the creation,
without form and void. There was no musical
rhythm in either the Ambrosian chant,
which followed the prosodial quantity of the
words, nor in the Gregorian, which did not
follow it. The text was prose; consequently
it did not have a regular recurrence of long
and short syllables, as poetry does, and therefore
the music, following the text, could not
have rhythm. All that existed in the beginning
of the modern tone art was the raising
and lowering of the voice through a certain
number of intervals. How harmony and
rhythm made their appearance in the early
stages of the art, and what forms they took,
must next be related.</p>

of Franco, of Cologne&mdash;Establishment of Dual and
Triple Measure&mdash;Introduction of notes to represent

<p class="cap">IN the growth of modern music the second
step was the introduction of harmony.
The simultaneous sounding of notes of different
pitch in combinations called chords is
so essential a part of the music of today that
even the uneducated mind has difficulty in
conceiving a tune as wholly dissociated from
the coloring influences of its harmony. Every
schoolboy is accustomed to hearing melodies
with what he calls a "bass" (an accompaniment
founded on chords), and in the commonest
music-hall songs the familiar harmonies
are the results of centuries of experiment
among the ecclesiastical fathers of modern
music. It is difficult for us to understand
that there was a time when harmony was unknown
to musicians, but such is the case;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and the first experiments resulted in the use
of combinations which sound intolerable to
our ears, while some of those which we regard
as the most familiar and useful were
deemed unbearable by some of the early authorities.
For example, no modern chord
can be formed without the third, <i>i.e.</i>, the third
whole note above the key-note. In the key of
C that is E; in G it is B, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music019a.mid">Listen: Thirds</a></div>

<p class="center small smcap">[Two Note Chord]</p>

<p>Yet for several centuries after
harmony began to be employed
that particular combination was forbidden, so
that it was impossible to write the common
chord of C major</p>

<p class="center small smcap">[Three Note Chord]</p>

<p>or of any other modern
major key. The result was
that for several hundred years music
developed along lines not those of chord
harmony, the first rude experiments at
which early gave way to what is called
counterpoint. What that system was we
shall see in good time, but we must now
give our attention to the early attempts at
harmony.</p>

<p>The origin of modern harmony is wrapped
in obscurity. It is believed that the Greeks
knew something about chords and perhaps
used a few simple ones in playing accompaniments
on the lyre. But they made no extended
study of them, and the early fathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
who founded their system on Greek music,
had nothing to learn in this matter from the
Greeks. All steps in the development of
modern music have been the result of long
processes of growth, and it cannot be doubted
that many experiments in harmony were made
before the first treatise on the subject was
written. The first records of harmony are
found in an old work called "Enchiridion
Musicæ," and they speak of a system called
Organum or Diaphony, attributed to Hucbald,
a Benedictine monk of St. Armand, in
Flanders, near the close of the tenth century.
Hucbald appears to have studied Pythagoras's
musical system, in which intervals between
notes were measured according to the laws
of acoustics by the number of vibrations
made by each note in a second. Hucbald,
finding that certain intervals had a mathematical
ratio, decided that they must make
concords, and he founded his system of harmony
on that theory. He used the intervals
of the fourth, the fifth, and the octave. The
fourth is the fourth note of the major scale
in ascending, the fifth the fifth note, and the
octave the eighth, or the recurrence of the
key-note. To make this matter clearer, let
me state that modern scientists have decided
that the C below the staff, in the treble clef,
has 256 vibrations a minute. The next C
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
above has 512, just double. The F of this
scale, which is the fourth, has 384. This is
the sum of the first C increased by one-half
of itself. Consequently C and F make a
scientific concord and a musical one, too.
But there is hardly anything more disagreeable
to the modern ear than a series of consecutive
fourths. Yet Hucbald thought that
such a series must be scientifically correct,
and that it ought, therefore, to make good
music. So he wrote such harmonies as
these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music021.mid">Listen: Series of Fourths</a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/music021.png" width="400" height="77" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/music021x.png">View Larger Image Here.</a></div>
</div>

<p class="center small">[Series of Fourths: Sit glo-ri-a Do-mi-ni in sæ-cu-la.]</p>

<p>This is very unpleasant to modern ears, yet
it is not quite so bad as a series of fifths.
When Hucbald wished to write in four parts
he simply repeated the two treble parts in
the bass an octave lower. And when he wrote
in three parts he simply "doubled" the lower
note of his fourth or fifth in the octave above,
which is a process also forbidden in modern
part writing because it makes two parts the
same in melodic progression. Hucbald also
employed a form of harmony in which the
lowest note always remained the same. This
was what we now call a "drone bass," such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
as is heard in the bagpipe, and it was certainly
more flexible than the other kind because
it admitted of the use of other intervals
than the fourth and fifth. But the idea of
writing in more than one part, once having
appeared in music, developed itself gradually.
All the earliest harmonic combinations sound
ugly to our ears because of the difference in
the character of the old scales adapted from
Greek music for the Church and that of our
scale. If the harmonists of those early days
had been using our scale, no doubt they would
have discovered how to write fine chords.
They did, in the course of time, hit upon
some of the combinations now used, and so
the foundations of modern harmony were
laid. But the modern style of writing did
not come into use for several centuries after
Hucbald's time.</p>

<p>The next element of music which made its
appearance was rhythm. This came about
through the improvements in notation and
the practice of singers. It seems that after
learning to add a second part to the <i>cantus
firmus</i>, or chant, the singers, who were acquiring
considerable dexterity in their art, began
to ornament the additional part. This addition
of ornaments was called the art of descant,
because it was descanting upon a given
theme. The singers all took to it with delight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
because it gave them fine opportunities
for the display of their voices and of their
musical skill. In some parts of France and
the Netherlands this practice became a sort
of mania. The voice which carried the chant
was called the tenor, from the Latin <i>teneo</i>,
"I hold." The other voice added an ornamental
part <i>above</i> the chant, and as there was
no measure in music, the two parts seldom
came out together at the end. As long as
the voices had moved in parallel fourths or
fifths it was not difficult for them to keep
together, but with the descanter singing
two or more notes to every one of the
<i>cantus firmus</i> it was quite impossible for
them to do so. No one knows just when
this art of descant entered into music, but
it is certain that it was known some time
before the close of the twelfth century, for
it was about then that Franco, of Cologne,
made successful attempts to systematize notation,
and in doing so regulated the measure
of music.</p>

<p>The earliest form of notation of which we
have any knowledge is called the Neume notation.
These Neumes were much like Greek
accents in some respects, and in others resembled
a sort of shorthand. All that could
be accomplished by them was an indication
of the direction in which the voice was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
move, whether up or down, and of the number
of notes which it was to pass. In Hucbald's
day a series of horizontal lines, like
our musical staff (but containing many more
lines) was used. The names of the notes
were written opposite the ends of the spaces
between the lines, and then each syllable of
the text was written in the space belonging
to the note to which it was to be sung. Short
lines were drawn upward or downward, as the
case might be, between each syllable of one
part so that that part could be followed. Another
system in use in Hucbald's time, and
even later, was arranged this way, the letters
representing the tones:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music024.mid">Listen: Upward and Downward Lines</a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus024.png" width="400" height="54" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus024x.png">View Larger Image Here.</a></div>
</div>

<p class="center small">[Lau-de dig-num ca-nat sanc-tum.]</p>

<p>As time passed on it became evident that
there ought to be some way of indicating a
fixed pitch from which the notes were to start.
So a line was employed and the Neumes were
written in a definite manner with relation to
it. If the line was red, the chant was in the
key of F, and all melodies ended on F. If
the line was yellow, the key was C. In the
eleventh century both lines were used at the
same time, and the certainty of the meaning
of the Neumes became greater. Afterward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Guido, of Arezzo, a famous teacher and theorist,
who died in 1050, added two more lines,
and thus came into existence a four-line staff.
The character of the Neumes themselves had
undergone many alterations, until, in Guido's
time, they began to look a little like modern
notes. But still there was no rhythm in the
ecclesiastical music, and no way of representing
it in notation. Franco advocated the introduction
of measure into church music. He
did not, of course, invent it, for it already
existed in the popular songs and dances of
the people, and had existed in them from the
earliest times.</p>

<p>Franco was the first theorist to record the
distinction between dual and triple time. The
reader who is unacquainted with musical science
should learn that the rhythms of music
are like those of poetry. Instead of poetic
feet, music has "measures" separated by vertical
lines drawn through the staff, and called
"bars." Measures are often called bars. The
musical measure corresponds to the poetic
foot. A bar with two beats in it is like a
foot of two syllables, except that in music
the accent is normally always on the first
beat. A bar with three beats is like a dactyl,
one accented and two unaccented syllables,
or beats. Dual time, or measure, corresponds
to a poetic rhythm made up of two-syllable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
feet; triple time to one of three-syllable feet.
A polka is in dual time; a waltz, in triple
time. Franco first explained these points,
and insisted that triple ought to be used in
church music for the naïve reason that its
three beats in one bar made it resemble the
perfection of the Holy Trinity, three persons
in one God. He made many improvements
in harmony, among others recognizing the
third, already described, as a concord, though
not a perfect one. Another important feature
of Franco's teaching was his advocacy
of contrary motion of parts. The manner of
writing practised by Hucbald prescribed what
is called parallel motion; that is, the melody
of the <i>cantus firmus</i> and that of the descant
always rose or fell together. If the one ascended
one interval the other did so, too.
Contrary motion permits the parts to move
in opposite directions, and this makes it possible
to avoid such disagreeable arrangements
as consecutive fourths or fifths, and so leads
the way to a richer and more beautiful harmony.
Others had already practised what
Franco preached in regard to this matter, so
the most significant part of his work was that
which dealt with measure. In order to write
the measured music it was necessary to have
notes representing sounds of different duration,
and these notes Franco either invented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
or adopted. Here are the four notes which
he used:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus027.png" width="400" height="67" alt="Franco notes." />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/illus027x.png">View Larger Image Here.</a></div>
</div>

<p class="center small">[Longa. Brevis. Maxima or Duplex Longa. Semibrevis.]</p>

<p>These names mean "long," "short," "double
long," and "half short." The short note had
half the duration of the long, and the duplex
longa double it, while the semibrevis was half
the length of the short note. We still have
notes called breve and semibreve.</p>

<p>We have now seen how melody, harmony,
and rhythm entered the process of development
of modern music. But I have already
called attention to the fact that the early medieval
composers had no conception of a tune
founded on subservient harmony, such as is
now familiar to every one. They got their
ideas as to the plan of composition from the
art of descant, which consisted, as I have tried
to explain, in adding an ornamental part to
a selected chant. It became an essential of
music in those early days that this second
part should be melodious in itself. When
the early composers began to write in more
than two parts, they still preferred the style
in which every part was a melody in itself.
In our modern music the parts which constitute
the harmonic accompaniment of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
melody are not necessarily melodious in
themselves, as any one can easily see who
listens to the accompaniment of a popular
song. The early church composers knew
nothing about that kind of writing. They
did not have instrumental accompaniment at
all. Even after the organ began to be used,
it simply played the same notes that the
voices sang. The compositions were written
wholly for voices, and each voice part was a
melody in itself, and all sounding together
produced harmonious results. This kind
of writing is still employed at times. For instance,
in the finale of "Die Meistersinger"
overture, five different melodies are heard at
the same time. This method of composition
is called "polyphonic;" and we have now
reached the period at which the art of descant
developed into the art of counterpoint, upon
which polyphonic writing rests.</p>

"Sumer is icumen in"&mdash;Character of the French
music&mdash;The masses of Machaut and Tournay&mdash;The

<p class="cap">THERE is one peculiarity of the early
attempts at writing in several melodious
parts which must now be brought to the attention
of the reader, and which is very difficult
to explain to a person not versed in
musical laws. Instead of writing free melodies
to accompany the fixed chants, the early
composers took up the practice of making
the tune serve as its own accompaniment by
the employment of a number of ingenious
devices, all included in the art of counterpoint.
I shall presently endeavor to explain
the nature of this style of writing; but as
it began in France, we must first note the
historical facts in connection with the development
of musical art in that country. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
reader will remember that Charlemagne established
schools for the cultivation of the
Roman chant in many French towns. History
shows us that the connection between
France and the Roman Church grew closer and
closer until, under Philip the Fair, the State
dominated; and in the beginning of the fourteenth
century the papal court was removed
by the king to Avignon. In the twelfth century
the University of Paris became the centre
of study in Europe. It was natural in these
circumstances that the cultivation of Roman
Catholic church music should have flourished
in Paris, and that, about 1100 <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>, a distinct
school of French composers should have developed.
This school flourished until 1370,
and there has descended to us a knowledge
of nearly five hundred composers who belonged
to it. It would be impossible and
useless to attempt to tell the reader all about
these composers. What I desire to do is to
point out what this school accomplished in
the development of music.</p>

<p>Counterpoint is today the art of constructing
two or more melodies which can be sung
or played simultaneously without breaking
the rules of harmony. Originally, however,
it was the art of adding parts above or below
a part already selected. It originated, as we
have seen, in the practice of the descanters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
A part improvised by a descanter came to be
called <i>contrapunctus a mente</i> (a counterpoint
out of the head), while an additional part
written by a composer was called <i>contrapunctus
a penna</i> (a counterpoint from the pen).
As musicians acquired skill in the construction
of these additional parts, they began to
introduce new devices, and to write with
greater and greater freedom. The more free
their writing was, the further it tended to depart
from parallel motion. In the course of
time some one hit upon the musical device
called "imitation," which means the repetition
in a secondary part (say the bass) of
some passage already heard in the principal
part (the treble) while that principal part is
still going on. The result of this device is
that one portion of a melody is made to serve
as the second voice to another portion of it.
Who first hit upon this device, no one knows;
but the earliest example of it which has been
preserved is found in the "Posui adjutorum"
of Perotin, one of the first of the French
school of writers. Here is the passage;
and by giving it careful study the reader
will be able to understand the fundamental
principle of canon, fugue, and all the polyphonic
forms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="center small smcap">[1st Voice, 2nd Voice, Canon Form.]</p>

<p>I think that even a reader who is not a
musician can understand this. A is the first
half of a melody, and B is the second half.
While the first voice is singing the first half,
the second voice sings the second half as the
alto part of the first half. In order to make
the first half act as alto in the second half,
the composer had to push the second voice
one bar ahead of the first voice, and then to
add three extra notes to A in order to make
a conclusion to his alto part. There are
two imitations in this bit: the second half of
the part sung by the first voice imitates the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
first half of the second voice part, and the
second half of the second voice part imitates
the first half of the first voice part.</p>

<p>By extending and developing such imitation
as this, composers came to write in
"double counterpoint," which means the
construction of two parts in such a way that
their different portions can be transferred
from one to the other just as they are in the
selection from Perotin. The reader will see
at once that composing in this manner required
a great deal of calculation, and was a
constant tax on the ingenuity of the musician.
In its early stages it prevented any attempt
at making music expressive, and reduced composition
to a mere exercise of scientific skill.
But it forced the composers to a close study
of the materials of their art, and they acquired
a great mastery over them and constantly
learned more and more about the possibilities
of music. Double counterpoint, which
is at the foundation of the most rigid forms
of polyphonic writing, was generally known
in the French school at least as early as the
thirteenth century, but the example from
Perotin seems to show that at least some of
the composers knew it much earlier. This
might account for the existence of the celebrated
example of early English polyphony,
a "canon" called "Sumer is icumen in."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
This was discovered by Sir John Hawkins,
who wrote a history of music in 1776. Its
manuscript was copied by a monk of Reading,
John of Forneste, in 1228, and it must
have been composed shortly before that time.
The fact that Walter Odington, an Englishman,
wrote a treatise on music in 1230, when
the only famous school was that of Paris,
leads me to believe that these early English
composers were disciples of the French. But
it is certain that the composer of "Sumer is
icumen in" was a greater master of counterpoint
than his teachers, because this "canon"
is the finest specimen of polyphonic writing

I urge the reader to give careful attention to
the remarkable interweaving of the first four
voice parts. At the fifth bar of the melody,
in the first voice, the second voice enters
with the beginning of the air. When the
second voice reaches the fifth bar of the air,
the third voice comes in, and at the same
time the first voice begins the second half of
the melody. When the third voice reaches
the fifth bar of the first half of the air, the
fourth voice comes in, and the second voice
begins the second half. And so it goes on,
the entrances always being made according
to the rule established at the start, and each
voice singing the tune without the alteration
of a single interval to make it fit into the
scheme. Rigid imitation of this kind is
called "canon." In this particular canon the
two lowest voices have a bass in two parts,
written in double counterpoint, which they
sing over and over again all the way through.
A constantly repeated bass is called a "basso
ostinato," and this is the first example of it.</p>

<p>This kind of writing possessed the merit
of high organization, without which there can
be no work of art. One might search in vain
for evidences of artistic design in the early
Gregorian chant, while in such works as those
of the early Frenchmen and their English
disciples they confront one in every measure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
The result was that these writers developed
several kinds of contrapuntal writing. But
it must be admitted that their work was cold
and mathematical, being wholly the result of
ingenious calculation. Furthermore it must be
borne in mind that they had no conception
whatever of music as a means of expression.
In a vague way they felt its suitability to the
worship of their churches, and its Gothic
complexity did indeed harmonize well with
ecclesiastical architecture. But it never occurred
to the composers of the French school
to try to make music beautiful for its own
sake. They were too busy exploring the resources
of their art, and their <i>materia musica</i>
was as yet too scanty to allow them to treat
their art with the command of mastership.
But they served well the cause of music by
discovering many of its essential rules, and
by formulating in their treatises much of its
fundamental theory. It is not at all surprising
that in the last period of this school we
meet with a large work. The last important
master of the school was William of Machaut,
who flourished between 1284 and 1369, and
wrote the mass for the coronation of Charles
V. of France.</p>

<p>The teachings of the French spread into
Belgium, and there arose a school called the
Gallo-Belgic. The first evidence of its existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
is found in the mass of Tournay, sung
by the choristers of the Tournay cathedral.
Its composer is unknown, but it was written
about 1330. It is in three parts, the tenor
(voice carrying the fixed chant) in the middle,
the descant (or counterpoint) above, and a
bass below. It is not nearly so well developed
in its polyphony as "Sumer is icumen
in" or the works of the Frenchmen. Two
of its voices move always in parallel fourths
or fifths (as in Hucbald's "organum") and
the other has a contrary motion. The most
famous composer of the Gallo-Belgic school
was William Dufay, born 1400, died 1474.
He almost wholly abandoned the use of parallel
fourths and fifths, which did so much to
restrict composition, and he also adopted the
open-note notation, which had made its appearance
in France in the closing years of
the French school. Dufay used the following
notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have placed under Dufay's notes their
present equivalents, with the names. Dufay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
is the first composer of whom it is known
that he made earnest efforts toward a more
plastic style of composition than that previously
in vogue. This was undoubtedly due
to the considerable development of the art
of composition. In his search after a freer
style, he abandoned the strict "canon," and
used "imitation" only here and there in his
works. Furthermore, he discerned the musical
worth of the songs of the people, and in
doing so paved the way for the exertion of
a large influence by folk-song upon artistic
composition. His method of using the popular
songs, however, was as bad as it was
remarkable. In composing a mass he would
substitute in place of the fixed chant of the
liturgy some popular air; and he put the words
in along with it, probably because the words
of the liturgy could not be sung to the
tune. Hence, in three masses by Dufay, still
extant, the melodies and texts of three songs
of his day are found. One of these songs,
"L'Omme Armée," became such a favorite
that for more than a century nearly every
prominent composer wrote a contrapuntal
mass around it. This abuse had finally to be
checked by the authorities of the Church.
Dufay did another thing, of more benefit to
music. He wrote some music in a very
simple style, in which there were passages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
pure chord harmony, such as we use in our
music today. As an example of this, I quote
the beginning of a fragment of one of his
masses, reproduced in Naumann's "History
of Music":&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="center small">[Dufay Mass]</p>

<p>Before Dufay's death the Gallo-Belgic
school began to be overshadowed by that of
the Netherlands, with which the art of writing
unaccompanied church counterpoint reached
its climax. To this school we must now
turn our attention.</p>

<h3>The Golden Age of Church Counterpoint</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">The great Netherlands school&mdash;Okeghem and the mechanics
of music&mdash;Riddles in tone&mdash;The advent of pure beauty&mdash;Work
of Josquin des Prés&mdash;Attempts at expression
by Willaert and others&mdash;Secular music&mdash;Orlando
Lasso and his beautiful works.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">AT the period of musical history which we
have now reached, the Dutch, as I
have had occasion to say in another work,
"led the world in painting, in liberal arts,
and in commercial enterprise. Their skill in
mechanics was unequalled, and we naturally
expect to see their musicians further the
development of musical technic." The Dutch
musicians at first revelled in the exercise
of mechanical ingenuity in the construction
of intricate contrapuntal music. In the
first period of their great school they acquired
by such exercise so great a mastery of the
materials of their art that in the second period
they began to make serious attempts at writing
beautiful music for beauty's sake. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
third period the possibilities of writing something
different from church music began to
be developed, and we find the Dutch masters
attempting the description in tones of external
phenomena by the process called tone-painting.
This period also saw secular music
taken into the fold of art, and began the production
of madrigals and other secular songs.
In the fourth period the dry old science of
counterpoint was so completely conquered
that the composers of the time were able to
make it the vehicle of the purest expression
of religious devotion the world has yet found,
and church music passed through its golden
age. On account of these facts let us consider
this great school, which had more influence
on the development of music than any
other school in the history of music, under
the following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 small"><span class="smcap">Netherlands School</span> (1425-1625 <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>).</p>

<p class="p2 small"><i>First Period</i> (1425-1512).&mdash;Perfection of contrapuntal
technics. Chief masters: Okeghem,
Hobrecht, Brumel.<br />

<i>Second Period</i> (1455-1526).&mdash;Attempts at pure
beauty. Chief master, Josquin des Prés.<br />

<i>Third Period</i> (1495-1572).&mdash;Development of
tone-painting and secular music. Chief masters:
Gombert, Willaert, Goudimel, Di Rore, Jannequin,
Arcadelt.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i>Fourth Period</i> (1520-1625).&mdash;Counterpoint
made subservient to expression of religious feeling.
Chief masters: Orlando Lasso, Swelinck,
De Monte.</p>

<p>The reader will note that the division of
these periods is not based on chronological,
but artistic grounds; and hence, in respect of
years, they overlap. The most famous writer
of the first period was Johannes Okeghem,
born between 1415 and 1430, in East Flanders.
He studied under Binchois, a contemporary
of Dufay, at Antwerp, was a singer
in the service of Charles VII. of France in
1444, was made by Louis XI. Treasurer of
the Cathedral of St. Martin's at Tours, and
died there about 1513. A considerable quantity
of his music has been preserved. It is
notable chiefly for its technical skill; and
during his life Okeghem was the most famous
teacher of his day. His most noted pupil
was Antoine Brumel (1460-1520), whose
personal history is lost, though many of his
masses and motets are preserved. Jacob
Hobrecht (1430-) achieved great celebrity.
Eight of his masses are extant. As I
have said in another account of the Netherlands
school, "It is the prevailing influence
of one or two masters in each period that
marks its extent. Its character was formed
by that influence, and salient features of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
style of each period may be fairly distinguished.
The first period was marked by the
extreme development of the 'canon.'" I
have already endeavored to explain the nature
of canonic writing. If the reader will
bear in mind that it is the most rigid form
of imitation, requiring the original melody
to be imitated throughout in the subsidiary
parts, he will not go astray. Okeghem and
his contemporaries completely explored the
resources of canonic writing. They invented
all kinds of canons. They originated the
'crab' canon, in which the part sung by the
second voice was the first voice part written
backwards. Here is an example taken from
a text-book by Dr. Bridge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music047.mid">Listen: 'Crab' Cannon</a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/music047.png" width="400" height="289" alt="" />

</div>

<p class="center small">['CRAB' CANON, OR CANON RECTE ET RETRO.<br />
<i>Begin at either end; play either forward or backward.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
You can sing or play this through forward
and then backward, and its counterpoint remains
correct. They had also the inverted
canon, in which the second part consisted of
the first part turned upside down. The canon
by augmentation makes the melody appear in
a subsidiary part in notes longer than those
in which it appeared in the principal part;
and the canon by diminution is formed on
the opposite principle. These old musical
puzzle-workers had other forms far more
complicated, and they took great delight in
writing "riddle" canons. In these only the
subject was given, with the motto, "Ex una,
plures," meaning that the musician must work
out the other parts from the one; and then
some hint as to the manner of working them
out would be given, as, "Ad medium referas,
pauses relinque priores." The working out
of these riddle canons became a mania with
Okeghem and his immediate successors; and
the result was that they acquired an immense
command over the technics of contrapuntal
writing. But "the highest praise that can be
awarded to their works is that they are profound
in their scholarship, not without evidences
of taste in the selection of the formulas
to be employed, and certainly imbued with a
good deal of the dignity which would inevitably
result from a skilful contrapuntal treatment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the church chant." It is, however,
of singular significance in the history of this
period that some of the works of both Hobrecht
and Brumel show a tendency toward
some conception of chord harmonies. Here
is an example, which looks modern:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BEGINNING OF A MOTET BY BRUMEL.<br />

</div>

<p class="center small">[O Do-mi-ne Je-su Christ . . . . . e.]</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the first period of
the Netherlands school was characterized by
a devotion to the mechanics of music. The
second period was illuminated and dominated
by the famous Josquin des Prés, whose music
is still heard at times, and is still ravishing to
the ear. Josquin was born at Condé in or
about 1450, and was a pupil of Okeghem.
He was a singer in the Sistine Chapel at
Rome, and on the death of Sixtus IV., in
1484, went to the court of Hercules d'Est,
Duke of Ferrara. He was afterward a short
time in the service of Louis XII. of France,
and finally of Maximilian I., Emperor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Netherlands, who made him provost of the
Cathedral of Condé. In that town he died,
on August 27, 1521. A large number of his
works exists. There are in print nineteen
masses, fifty secular pieces, and over one hundred
and fifty motets. Josquin is the first
genius in the development of music who had
sufficient musical material already formulated
to enable him to write freely. His works are
notable for their elegance of style, and for the
firm mastery of the difficult counterpoint of
his time. Martin Luther, noting how he
moulded seemingly inflexible material to his
purpose, said, "Josquin is a master of the
notes; they have to do as he wills; other
composers must do as the notes will." Baini,
the biographer of Palestrina, in describing the
immense popularity of Josquin's compositions,
says that there was "only Josquin in
Italy, only Josquin in France, only Josquin
in Germany; in Flanders, in Bohemia, in
Hungary, in Spain, only Josquin." In its
technical aspect Josquin's music presents for
consideration no special feature, except that
he wrote always in more than two parts. His
music is notable chiefly for its pure beauty,
and he was the first composer to make a determined
effort to secure that. He was able
to do this because his predecessors had so
fully developed the technics of polyphonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
writing. Josquin, however, was not without
grave faults. He continued the practice of
using secular airs in the mass, and wrote a
mass on "L'Omme Armée." He also had
the bad taste twice to set to music the genealogy
of Christ, a mere catalogue of names.</p>

<p>The third period was very rich in masters
of ability. Of Gombert little is known save
that he was a pupil of Josquin. Adrian Willaert,
the most brilliant light of his period,
was born at Bruges in 1480, and was a pupil
of either Josquin or Jean Mouton. After
many changes he settled in Venice, where on
Dec. 12, 1527, the doge, Andrea Gritti, appointed
him chapel master of St. Mark's.
He carried the teachings of the Netherlands
school into Italy, became the head of a great
music school, was the teacher of many noted
organists, and had a profound and wide influence
on musical art. Claude Goudimel was
born in 1510, founded a music school in
Rome, and was the teacher of the great Palestrina.
He subsequently went to Paris, became
a Protestant, and was killed in the
massacre on St. Bartholomew's eve, Aug. 24,
1572. Cyprian di Rore was born in Brabant
in 1516, and succeeded Willaert as
chapel master of St. Mark's in Venice. He
died in 1565. Clement Jannequin was a
native of Flanders. Little is known of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
life, but some of his compositions are extant.
Willaert's work must first claim our attention.
Finding two organs in St. Mark's he
introduced antiphonal writing into the music
of his time. He wrote some of his grand
works for two choruses of four parts each,
so that each chorus could answer the other
across the church. He paid much less attention
to rigid canonic style than his predecessors
had done, because it was not suited to
the kind of music which he felt was fitting
for his church. He sought for grand, broad
mass effects, which he learned could be obtained
only by the employment of frequent
passages in chords. So he began trying to
write his counterpoint in such a way that the
voice parts should often come together in
successions of chords. In order to do this
he was compelled to adopt the kind of chord
formations still in use and the fundamental
chord relations of modern music,&mdash;the tonic,
dominant, and subdominant. The tonic is
the chord of the key in which one is writing;
the subdominant is that of the fourth note
of the scale of that key; and the dominant
that of the fifth, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music052.mid">Listen: Chord Formations</a></div>

</div>

<p class="center small">[Tonic. Subdominant. Dominant. Tonic.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
This is the succession of chords which
children strum when they try to play accompaniments
on the piano. It is the simplest
progression of harmony we have, and lies at
the basis of all our common tunes. It is
called diatonic harmony because it is formed of
chords on the whole tones of the scale, in contradistinction
to chromatic harmony, founded
on the chords of the semitones. It is necessary
to speak of chromatic harmony here,
because Cyprian di Rore made a special study
of it, and his "Chromatic Madrigals," published
in 1544, had a great influence upon
the progress of music. The old church scales
were essentially diatonic, and chromatic harmonies
were not practicable in music written
in those scales. Di Rore's madrigals were
influential in showing composers how they
could write more flexibly and more beautifully
by breaking the shackles of the old
Gregorian scales. Still, most of the music
of that time continued to be essentially diatonic,
for the composers had just begun to
explore the possibilities of chord modulation.
These possibilities do not seem to have been
exhausted even by the music of Wagner.</p>

<p>The development of secular music at this
time was remarkable. The scientific composers
began to make a practice of writing
music to be used outside of the church. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wrote madrigals and other part-songs of real
merit, and in them they made attempts at
expression. Of course these first attempts
were purely imitative. The composers tried
to imitate natural sounds and movements in
music. Gombert wrote a clever and humorous
"Bird Cantata." Jannequin, in his "Cris
de Paris," tried to paint the street life of the
French capital, while his "Le Bataille" is
a military picture in music. These remarkable
descriptive pieces were written for four
voices, unaccompanied, and in polyphonic
style. After trying to tell some kind of a
story in secular music they tried it in religious
music. One of Willaert's motets, at any rate,
tells the story of Susannah, and is plainly a
forerunner of the oratorio. We have seen
now how the first period of the Netherlands
school brought contrapuntal technics to a
high state of development, how the second
period produced a genius and a desire for
pure beauty, and how the third period introduced
a broader, simpler, and more imposing
style into church music and made definite
attempts at expression. We now come to
the fourth period, which was destined to bring
ecclesiastical counterpoint to its perfection.
This period also produced a master of splendid
genius, whose works live yet and ought to
live as long as there is a place in the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Church for pure and lofty music. This man
was Roland Delattre, usually known by the
Italian form of his name, Orlando Lasso, or
di Lasso.</p>

<p>Lasso was born in Mons, between 1520
and 1530. He studied at home, at Milan,
Naples, and Rome, and at an early age became
chapel master of the Church of St.
John Lateran. In 1557 he went to Munich
as director of the ducal choir. There he
passed most of the remainder of his life,
dying there on June 14, 1594. He was a
contemporary of the great Palestrina, whose
fame his far outshone. Lasso was celebrated
all over Europe, was employed and honored
by monarchs, and was called the "Prince of
Music." He was one of the most prolific
composers that ever lived. He is said to
have written 2,500 works. Many of his
compositions are in print today, and his
quaintly beautiful madrigal, "Matona, mia
cara," is often heard in concert. Other composers
of this period were Jan Peters Swelinck,
pupil of Cyprian di Rore, born at
Deventer, 1540, died at Amsterdam, 1621,
and Philip de Monte (1521-). Their
work was by no means without merit, but
it was overshadowed by that of their great
contemporary.</p>

<p>Lasso was a complete master of the counterpoint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of his time, but he aimed at making
it a vehicle of expression for religious feeling,
and succeeded. He adapted his style to his
purposes. Sometimes he wrote pure hymn-tunes
in four-part chords, much like our
modern hymns. If he was writing for grand
and imposing effects, he could handle the
most complicated polyphony with ease. He
wrote works for two and three choirs, and
other works for only two voices. His famous
"Penitential Psalms" are for two voices, and
are marvellously beautiful and pathetic. Yet
some of Lasso's music is as old-fashioned and
stiff as Okeghem's. Again he becomes almost
modern in his employment of chromatics.
But there is one notable feature of Lasso's
work: it contains no parade of contrapuntal
difficulties for their own sake. On the
contrary, it is admirable for the skill with
which it conceals its own mechanical ingenuity
and presents an appearance of spontaneity and
fluency. It abounds in the highest and purest
expression of religious feeling, and it is
always beautiful as music per se. In fine
we always know, when listening to the works
of Lasso, that we are in the presence of a
genius.</p>

<p>We have now reached the period at which
Italy became the home of modern music.
Willaert and Di Rore in Venice, Goudimel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and Lasso in Rome sowed seed which was
to produce beautiful fruit. At the same
time influences were at work which introduced
a simpler style into music and which
made it an art more popular with the masses.
One of these influences was the music of
those very masses. The popular songs of
the day had, as we have seen, long ago forced
themselves upon the attention of the artistic
composers. The time was now approaching
when those composers turned to the popular
music for suggestions as to the future development
of their art. Before entering upon
an account of the birth of a new style in
music, the reader must go back with me and
take a rapid view of the growth of the folk-song.</p>

<h3>Progress of Popular Music</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Troubadours, jongleurs, minnesingers, and meistersingers&mdash;Wagner's
"Tannhäuser" and "Die Meistersinger"
as historical pictures&mdash;The German volkslied&mdash;The
musical guilds&mdash;The waits and the minstrels.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">WE saw that as far back as Dufay's time
composers began to introduce secular
melodies into the mass. This was an evidence
that the ecclesiastical composers had
been forced to make attempts to popularize
their works by a rude adoption of the melodies
of the people. The question, therefore,
naturally arises: Who were the composers
of the secular music? Of course that is a
question that cannot be answered very definitely,
but we do know who were the secular
musicians of the time, and we know that they
were nearer the fundamental principles of
modern music than the churchmen were.
The enormous mass of ecclesiastical music
produced in the middle ages was fit only for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the worship of cathedrals. It could never
have been made to utter the notes of human
passion, and until some other style was found,
the modern symphony, song, and opera must
have remained impossible. Church counterpoint
survives today only in church music
and in the German fugue, a form of music
which is conspicuous for its intellectual rather
than its emotional qualities. The early secular
musicians had no science at all, and very
little art. Their music was, therefore, simple
and unpretentious, but it contained the germs
of our modern art forms, and it was bound
in time to force its way into the studies of
the fathers.</p>

<p>The secular musicians of the early time
were wanderers on the face of Europe. They
were the troubadours, jongleurs, minnesingers,
meistersingers, and minstrels.</p>

<p>The whole race of strolling musicians in
the middle ages almost certainly descended
from the Roman comedians who were driven
out of the seven-hilled city when Alaric swept
down upon it with fire and the sword. They
wandered into foreign lands to sing and pipe
before the Frankish chiefs, now their lords
and masters. In the earliest days they were
simple vagabonds, whom the law did not
allow redress for bodily injury wantonly inflicted.
In the latter half of the twelfth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the early part of the thirteenth centuries
these strolling musicians began to be employed
in the mysteries and miracle plays,
and thus gradually arose in the public estimation.
Even before that time they had
begun to be taken into the service of the
knightly troubadours and minnesingers as
accompanists, their French title being jongleurs.</p>

<p>Subsequently it became their business to
go about singing the songs of their masters,
in short, to become their publishers. The
troubadours themselves were nobles, originally
those of southeastern France. They
got their first inspiration from the folk songs,
but their own songs were distinguished by
refinement and improved melody. These
knightly singers existed simultaneously with
the jongleurs, who sang and played for
money. The most celebrated troubadours
were King Thibaut, of Navarre (1201-1253),
and Adam de la Halle (1240-1286). It is
a notable and significant fact that the songs
of the troubadours, like most of the folk
songs, ignored the church modes and moved
in the modern major and minor keys.</p>

<p>The last of the German minnesingers,
Heinrich von Meissen, died in 1318, but
the celebrated Confrèrie de St. Julien des
Ménestriers, of Paris, lasted at any rate till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
1741, for it is recorded that in that year
Louis XV. made Jean Pierre Guignon "le
Roy des Violons." The songs of the troubadours
and wandering minstrels were the
popular songs of the day of Columbus, and
in Spain the troubadours still survived. The
character of the music sung by these persons
is well described by Fanny Raymond Ritter
in her "Essay on the Troubadours." She
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3 small">"The merit of the troubadours in furthering the
progress of music as an art was that they liberated
melody from the fetters of calculation, gave it the
stamp of individuality, and bore it on the wings of
fancy into the domains of sentiment. They had
the further merit of introducing new and peculiar
changes of time, which, apparently irregular, were
really forcible, symmetrical, and original. It is
also more than probable that the troubadours received
new ideas in regard to melody from the
East; as they found among the Arabs not only a
different system of tones, but many fanciful vocal
ornaments then unknown in Europe, and which
they introduced in their own songs on their return
from the Crusades. But as harmony was in that
day yet undeveloped, the flowing vine of melody
received little support from it, and therefore often
appears weak. The rules of composition were
then highly complicated and ill classified, yet they
were well understood by the best educated troubadours;
and though their earlier songs were stiff,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
closely resembling the Gregorian chant in form
and style, in some of the latter ones we find graceful
melodies that leave little to be desired, and
that possess more real variety and individuality of
character than do the words attached to them."</p>

<p>It is not a far cry from France to Germany
across the Rhine, and the chanson of the
troubadour soon found its counterpart in the
minnesong of the fatherland. The era of
the minnesinger has been divided into three
periods. The first, whose beginning is not
definitely fixed, ended near the close of the
twelfth century. The second period comprised
the last decade of the twelfth century
and the first half of the thirteenth. It was
the golden age of the minnesong, the age
of Wagner's "Tannhäuser" and the great
Sängerkrieg at the Wartburg Castle, the age
of the Landgrave Hermann, Wolfram von
Eschenbach, and Walther von der Vogelweide.
This time has been made alive for us by the
genius of Wagner, whose contest in "Tannhäuser"
introduces the actual personages of
the real story. The third period was that
of decline. The fourteenth century saw the
gradual decrease of feudal power, and the
burghers and artisans dared to do what
had hitherto been reserved for their lordly
masters. Thus the minnesong was supplanted
by the meistersong, and the meistersinger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
became the musical lawgiver of
Germany.</p>

<p>The songs of the meistersingers were
somewhat stiff and formal, yet not lacking
in melody, as that used by Wagner as the
theme of his march goes to show. Perhaps
no better description of a meistersong could
be given here than that sung by "Kothner"
in expounding the "Leges Tabulaturæ" to
"Walther von Stolzing":&mdash;</p>

<p class="poetry small">
Each mastersinger-created stave
<br />
Its regular measurement must have,
<br />
By sundry regulations stated
<br />
And never violated.
<br />
What we call a section is two stanzas;
<br />
For each the self-same melody answers:
<br />
A stanza several lines doth blend,
<br />
And each line with a rhyme must end.
<br />
Then come we to the "After Song,"
<br />
Which must be also some lines long,
<br />
And have its especial melody,
<br />
Which from the other diff'rent must be.
<br />
So staves and sections of such measure
<br />
A mastersong may have at pleasure.
<br />
He who a new song can outpour
<br />
Which in four syllables&mdash;not more&mdash;
<br />
Another strain doth plagiarize,
<br />
He may obtain the master prize.</p>

<p>In Germany, too, flourished the folk song.
Who wrote the old volkslieder no one knows,
but many of them have been preserved to
us. The "Limburg Chronicle" contains
a number in use between 1347 and 1380,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and the "Locheimer Liederbuch" is a collection
dated 1452. H. de Zeelandia, in
his "Lehrcompendium," gives many in
vogue in the first half of the fifteenth century.
The essential features of the volkslieder
are clearness and symmetry of melody
and firmness of rhythm. The early ones
also display a constant tendency to escape
from the fetters of the ecclesiastical modes.
In fact to them is due the final development
of modern tonality.</p>

<p>The German church music of the time,
from which developed the chorale, was
founded on the volkslied. The familiar
example of "Isbruck, ich muss dich lassen,"
set in four parts by Heinrich Isaak in 1475,
and adapted after the Reformation by Dr.
Hesse as "O Welt, ich muss dich lassen,"
was but the continuation of the practice of
Heinrich von Laufenberg, who in the fifteenth
century set sacred words to secular
tunes continually. This brief review of the
state of music in Germany in the time of the
Netherlands school shows us that the volkslied
and the meistersong were the ruling
powers, and that there was as yet no foreshadowing
of the mighty art which has since
developed in the land of the Teutons.</p>

<p>In these days existed also the musical
guilds which were the forerunners of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
continental town orchestras. As far back as
the thirteenth century the strolling musicians
began to gather in towns, and there they
formed societies for the protection of their
common interests. Some of them became
town pipers, and in the fifteenth century
some were made town and corporation trumpeters.
One result of the work of the guilds
at this time was that musicians began to acquire
some of the rights of citizenship. The
guilds were accustomed to place themselves
under the patronage of some noble, who
selected from the guild a "piper king." It
was his business to see that "no player,
whether he be piper, drummer, fiddler,
trumpeter, or performer on any instrument,
be allowed to accept engagements of any
kind, whether in towns, villages, or hamlets,
unless he had previously enrolled himself a
member of the guild." At irregular intervals
a court was assembled, consisting of a
mayor, four masters, twelve ordinary members,
and a beadle, whose business it was to
mete out punishment to guild offenders.
These guilds were simply the musical protective
unions of the day. Outside of the
German nations, where these guilds did not
exist, the ordinary musician was a stroller,
with hardly any legal rights and no consideration.
His occupation was regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
menial, and the servants of the knights
treated him with contempt. The jongleur
who played the accompaniments for the
troubadour, or even sang his songs when the
master had no voice, was regarded as a servant
and nothing more. The idea of any
musician being entitled to the consideration
of an artist, except the great church composers,
would have been scouted.</p>

<p>In England the strolling musician was
represented by the minstrel and the waits,
and his status was about the same as it was
on the Continent. In a somewhat better
case were those who were under the protection
of some prince or noble. For instance,
the children of the chapel ate in the chapel
hall with the yeomen of the vestry and were
well cared for. They were the young students
of choir singing, instructed by a
master of song, who was appointed by the
dean of the chapel. These children we find
as a part of the household establishment of
Edward IV., who died in 1483.</p>

<p>The musicians of the Church were in much
better circumstances. As far back as the
time of William the Conqueror we find
that Hereford Cathedral had endowments
which included support for seven choristers.
We find similar endowments granted to St.
Gregory's in 1363; to Wells in 1347; to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the collegiate churches of Southwell, in Nottinghamshire;
to Beverley, in Yorkshire, and
Westminster. At Oxford, New College
had an endowment for sixteen choristers,
and Magdalen, All Souls', and St. John's had
similar funds. Nearer to Okeghem's day
the famous Dick Whittington, Lord Mayor
of London, in 1424 founded an endowment
for choristers in the Church of St. Michael
Royal, which he built. Nevertheless, the
first recorded case of a salaried organist is
that of Leonard Fitz Simon, organist of
Trinity College, Oxford, about 1580, at 20s.
per year.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of the popular
music of the early times,&mdash;the first a song by
King Thibaut of Navarre, and the second
the first part of the old meistersong used
by Wagner in "Die Meistersinger":&mdash;</p>

The reader will note that in the first of
these there is a clearly marked rhythmic
movement of the simplest kind. The tune
is distinctly in the modern key of G major,
and it is not polyphonic. The second tune
is in F major and while its rhythm is not
clearly indicated, it is plainly not a polyphonic
composition. The directness of this
kind of music and its suitability to the expression
of simple feelings were bound to make
themselves felt sooner or later in music. We
are now to examine into the causes which led
to the simplification of church music and
forced composers to turn their attention
more and more to the music of the people.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

Renaissance and the Reformation&mdash;The Council
of Trent&mdash;Palestrina and his music&mdash;Last days of
the Roman and Venetian schools&mdash;The English cathedral

<p class="cap">IT is hardly necessary to tell the reader
that the methods employed in writing
church music prior to the dawn of the seventeenth
century were not always judicious.
The use of secular tunes together with their
texts prevailed for more than two centuries,
and led to great laxity in the treatment of the
liturgy. In the course of time too many
composers came to regard the words of the
mass as mere pegs to hang tunes on, and the
tremendous complexity of the huge polyphonic
works was such that the words could
not be distinguished. One part would be
singing "gloria in excelsis" while another
was thundering "et in terra pax," and there
was such a jumble of words and music that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
while it was all very imposing, it was not comprehensible
to the congregation. As long as
the congregation knew very little Latin, and
less music, this condition did not have serious
effects; but the time had now come when
the people began to ask questions. It becomes
our duty, then, to inquire what influences
led to reforms in church music. I shall
first enumerate the influences and afterward
discuss them in detail.</p>

<p class="p3 small">1. The revival of Greek learning in Italy after
a lapse of seven hundred years.<br />
2. The invention of printing.<br />
3. The Renaissance.<br />
4. Popular music.<br />
5. The diffusion of musical learning among the
people.<br />
6. The Lutheran choral hymn and congregational
singing.</p>

<p>In 1453 the Turks, under Mohammed
II., slew Constantine, last of the Roman emperors,
and overthrew Rome's eastern empire,
whose capital was Constantinople. The
Christian scholars of Turkey fled toward the
home capital of their fallen empire, and took
up their residence in Italy. These scholars
were all masters of the Greek tongue, and
they awakened a new interest in it and its
literature. The field had been untouched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
for about seven centuries, and the whole treasury
of Greek history, oratory, and poetry was
reopened to the Italian mind. Its effects were
wide and general. One of them was to lead
to the study of the New Testament in the
original tongue, and this study very speedily
demonstrated the unworthiness of the Latin
Vulgate used by the Church. Any blow at
Latin was a blow at the authority of Rome.
The whole Italian system of worship had
been built upon the Vulgate, which was in
the language authorized in the Roman Church
throughout western Europe, and used as
the sole means of intercommunication between
its branches in various nations. Doctrines
and edicts alike proceeded from Rome
in the ancient language of the city, and to
throw discredit upon the veracity of that
tongue in the Vulgate was to subject it to
general doubt and suspicion. Such doubt
did certainly spread among the people, who
began to demand a clearer comprehension
of the liturgy. To this end they desired a
less complex setting of the musical part of
the church service.</p>

<p>This demand was powerfully backed by
the introduction of printing in 1444. This
introduction resulted in lowering the price
of books, and a plentiful supply of cheap
reading attracted readers. Hence the mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of the Roman Catholic laity became readers as
well as listeners. The whole system of worship
had been based on the existence of a non-reading
public. But now the age of popular
inquiry began, and it became necessary for
church music to abandon its complexity and
address itself to meet the demands of awakening
intelligence.</p>

<p>The dawn of the Renaissance in art was
caused by the revival of Greek learning,
which reintroduced Greek models. The
enormous effect of a new contemplation by
the Italian mind of Doric architecture and
Greek sculpture can hardly be comprehended
by us to whom these things are so familiar.
The force and beauty of simplicity were
brought home to the people by the very examples
which awoke in them a desire for imaginative
life and personal expression. The
Renaissance led to a clearer, stronger, more
eloquent style in all art, and in time it was
bound to make itself felt in music. The fact
that Leonardo da Vinci worked before Josquin
des Prés proves nothing except that
music was behind the other arts in the development
of her technic, and had to work
out her own laws of existence before she could
feel the influence of reformatory thought.</p>

<p>The popular music of the time naturally
appealed to composers as their feeling for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
distinctly outlined form increased, and this
feeling was directly influenced by the artistic
teachings of the Renaissance. As art remodelled
itself on Greek patterns, and architecture
found in the Doric lines a relief to
the endless details of the Gothic, so music
inclined toward the simple contours of the
song-forms. The elementary attraction of
pure rhythm grew in potency as composers
realized more clearly that it was one of the
fundamental components of music; and with
a recognition of this fact came that of the
deeper significance of chord harmony. The
folk-song itself had always clung to the major
and minor scales, and had not often employed
the purely ecclesiastical modes. The
mode known as the Ionic&mdash;the old Greek
Lydian mode, condemned by the ancients as
lascivious&mdash;was nothing more nor less than
our major scale of G, and as such the church
composers knew it. Its possibilities made
themselves more and more clear as the artistic
musicians of the day studied the popular
tunes, and so in time it came to its true seat
of honor in music.</p>

<p>A knowledge of music had begun to
spread among the people. Not only did
the constant hearing of the noble masterpieces
of their time tend to cultivate their
taste, but they began to practise music themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Conservatories had been founded in
Venice, Rome, and other cities, and as far
back as Willaert's day it was fashionable for
young ladies of good family to learn to play
the monochord, one of the precursors of
the piano. The music written for the instrument
was precisely like that for the organ,
polyphonic in style and learned in treatment.
The study of such music was naturally very
difficult for beginners, and it became necessary
to supply them with something simpler.</p>

<p>The music of the Roman Church was
brought into strong contrast with that employed
by Luther in his work of the Reformation.
Luther insisted on the exercise of
individuality in worship. He held, contrary
to the Church, that every man had a right
to study the Bible for himself. He even
gave communion to the laity. In direct line
with such work was his revival of congregational
singing, which had been generally unpractised
since the days of Ambrose. The
first Lutheran hymn-book was published in
1524. Luther employed many extant folk songs
and caused new tunes like them to be
written. He is said to have written "A
stronghold sure." These Lutheran hymns
were broad and simple chorals, like those
of the Protestant Church of today. The
spread of their use among the Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
congregations of the time was an attraction
toward that form of worship which the authorities
of the Roman Church could not
ignore, and hence the Catholic composers
moved toward a simpler style.</p>

<p>The story of what followed the recognition
of these influences by the fathers of the
Church has been very prettily told, but
unfortunately it has been of late discredited.
The story is that two parties arose in the
Church, one of them demanding the abolition
of all the extant church music and a
return to the plain chant of Gregory, and
the other that the music of the time be
preserved, but its style simplified. The
Council of Trent (1562) discussed the matter,
and in 1563 Pope Pius IX. appointed a
commission of eight cardinals to take measures
of reform. Cardinals Borromeo and Vitellozzi,
appointed as a sub-committee, went to
Palestrina, whose music had already attracted
attention, and asked him to write a mass
demonstrating that the church music of the
time could be preserved. He entered upon
his task with such enthusiasm that he wrote
three masses, of which that called the Marcellus
mass was performed with enormous
success.</p>

<p>This story has been proved to be a myth.
The Council of Trent did pass a resolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
that a complete reform of church music was
necessary, but the demand was based, not on
the character of the music, but on the fact
that it made the text of the liturgy unintelligible.
The Council furthermore issued a
mandate to bishops to banish improper
music from their churches. This was, of
course, aimed at the secular airs, or those
which resembled them. The mass of Marcellus
was not written to order, and there was
nothing new in its style. The mass is
simply a model of all that was best in Palestrina's
day. It embodied all that was noblest
in the polyphonic style developed by the
Netherlands school. Its melody is pure,
sweet, and fluent, and its expressive capacity
perfectly adapted to the devotional spirit of
the text. Palestrina's contemporaries, such
as Lasso, and some of his predecessors, wrote
in the same style. Lasso's "Penitential
Psalms" are much simpler in style than this
mass. Its apparent simplicity lies in the
fact that its profound mastery of technical
resources conceals its superb art. The polyphonic
writing is matchless in its evenness;
every part is as good as every other part.
The harmonies are beautiful, yet there is
apparently no direct attempt to produce
them. They seem just to happen. But
above all other qualities stands the innate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
power of expression in this music. It is, as
Ambros has hinted, as if the composer had
brought the angelic host to earth.</p>

<p>With Palestrina church polyphony reached
its highest and its final development. The
search after simplicity led composers in a
path diverging widely from the old contrapuntal
highway. New developments in
secular music were soon to come about, and
still more powerfully to influence church
composition. The harvest and the glory of
vocal counterpoint had come, and thenceforth
musical art was to develop along new
and hitherto unexpected lines. A few words
should be written here concerning the career
of so great a man as Palestrina, who has
been universally accorded a seat among the
Titans of music. His full name was Giovanni
Pierluigi Sante, and he was called
Palestrina from the place of his nativity.
The date of his birth is uncertain, but it was
probably 1514. The portrait of him in the
pontifical chapel at Rome has an inscription
to the effect that he died in 1594, aged eighty.
He was the son of poor peasants and got
his first musical instruction as a choir singer.
In 1540 he went to Rome and became a student in Claude Goudimel's
conservatory. At the age of thirty he published his first
compositions, and some of them are still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
heard in the Sistine Chapel occasionally.
<a name="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor">[6.1]</a> He had previously served a short
period as organist and choir master in his native town, and in 1548
he married. In 1551 he succeeded Arcadelt as choir master of St.
Peter's, Rome, and the Pope made him one of the singers of the Papal
Chapel. In 1571 he was made chapel master of St. Peter's, and later, in
conjunction with his younger

contemporary Nanini, he founded a music
school in Rome. The influence of this
school was very great, and it kept the "Palestrina
style" alive in Europe for nearly a
century. Palestrina died on Feb. 2, 1594,
and the Supreme Council of the Church had
his body laid in the basilica of the Vatican
with the honors usually shown to a cardinal.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_6_1"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_6_1"><span class="label">[6.1]</span></a> At the time
of writing (October, 1897) Palestrina's works are not performed as
often as they used to be in the Papal Chapel, and there is a determined
movement on the part of some of the clergy for their restoration and a
more frequent use of the Gregorian chant. The movement is a healthful
one, and I wish it success.</div>

<p>Before leaving the subject of Palestrina, let
me endeavor to make clear to the reader
wherein his style is so fine. Composers
before him had begun to aim at the simplification
of church music. They sought to
accomplish their purpose by breaking the
shackles of canonic law. The canon had
demanded the most exact imitation in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
different voice parts. The new style allowed
the greatest freedom. The result was that
free polyphony took the place of rigid canon.
Consequently, composers were able to devote
more attention to the development of fluent,
beautiful, and expressive melody. The merit
of Palestrina's work was that it carried this
style to perfection. His compositions became
the models for succeeding composers,
and indeed they remain to this day unequalled
as examples of pure church music. In Palestrina's
music one must note the absence
of rhythmic effects, of modern tonality, and
of the note of passion. Palestrina paid little
attention to folk-music, but sought to attain
simplicity of style by preserving the old
church scales, avoiding chromatic harmonies,
and by generally preserving purity and contemplative
feeling. His writing is marvellous
in its contrapuntal skill, which makes
the apparently independent melodies of the
different voice parts constantly combine in
simple and lovely chords. The lack of contrast
in his music has often been quoted as a
fault; but it was in accordance with Palestrina's
own theory that church music should
always be dignified, and should never contain
anything exciting.</p>

<p>As we have now reached the period at
which artistic music began to develop in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
its branches, it will be most convenient to
narrate the progress of Roman Catholic
church music subsequent to Palestrina's time
before passing to other topics. The reader
must bear in mind that this music was still
designed to be sung without accompaniment,
in order that the tone-quality of pure vocal
sound might be untainted. When the organ
was first used it simply doubled the voice parts,
and when independent accompaniments
began to be written they considerably altered
the character of church music. There were
now two distinct schools of Catholic composition,&mdash;that
of Rome, and that of Venice.
The former followed the pure diatonic style
of Palestrina; the latter was influenced by the
style of Willaert and the chromatic music of
Di Rore. The chief masters of the Roman
school were Nanini, Vittoria, Anerio, and
Allegri. Giovanni Maria Nanini was born
in 1540 and died in 1607. He was a coworker
with Palestrina, and was the teacher of
many of the succeeding composers. His
"Hodie nobis c&oelig;lorum Rex" is still sung at
Christmas in the Papal Chapel. Tommaso
Ludovico da Vittoria was born about 1540,
and died about 1604. He is regarded as one
of the greatest of Palestrina's successors. A
goodly number of his works has been preserved.
His Requiem, written for the funeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of the Empress Maria (1603), is conceded to
be his greatest production, and is one of the
most notable compositions of that period.
"Technically considered, it is a marvellous
blending of old independent movement of
parts with modern dissonances and progressions.
Spiritually considered, it is a wonderful
expression of poignant personal sorrow,
chastened by religious contemplation and
devotion." The marks of change here are
the use of the dissonance and the expression
of personal feeling. The dissonance in music
embraces all those harmonies which sound
harsh to persons accustomed only to elementary
chords like the tonic, dominant, and
subdominant. They are used most freely in
modern operatic music, especially that of
Wagner, and have always been employed to
express passion of some kind. Palestrina
avoided them. Felice Anerio (1560-1630)
wrote many admirable masses. Gregorio
Allegri (1586-1652) is best known as the
composer of very fine "Misere" now sung
in Holy Week in the Sistine Chapel. This
work is regarded as equal to some of
Palestrina's.</p>

<p>The Venetian school, after its earliest period
produced two great composers from one
family. These were Andrea Gabrieli (1510-1586)
and his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
(1557-1613). The former followed Willaert's
plan of writing for antiphonal choruses,
but he employed most frequently three instead
of two. The latter was more of an
instrumental composer than his uncle, and
hence conceived the idea of writing instrumental
accompaniments. In his "Surrexit
Christus" he used an orchestral accompaniment
of first and second violins, two cornets,
and four trombones. This work of Giovanni
Gabrieli's fairly marks the termination of the
era of <i>a capella</i> (unaccompanied) polyphonic
church music. The opera had been born,
and so had the oratorio, and church music
began to borrow ideas from them. Giovanni
Legrenzi (1625-1690) increased Gabrieli's
orchestra to nineteen violins, two violas, three
viole da gamba, four theorboes (lutes of large
size), two cornets, one bassoon, and three
trombones. Antonio Lotti (1667-1740) was
an opera writer as well as a church composer,
and he wrote masses full of passionate feeling.
His later works are full of passages in which
the voices alternate with the instruments and
there are accompanied solos and choruses.
With Lotti, who used unaccompanied choruses
occasionally, we bid a final farewell to
the great period of <i>a capella</i> church music,
and enter upon the era in which music for
the church was made in the same way as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
other kinds. The masses of Mozart, Beethoven,
Cherubini, and other modern writers
are all richly instrumented.</p>

<p>England had fairly kept pace with the Continent
in her mastery of polyphony, which so
early produced the remarkable canon "Sumer
is icumen in." Thomas Tallys (born about
1520, died Nov. 23, 1585) was one of the
greatest of the English masters, and is regarded
as the father of English cathedral
music. His works do not equal those of
his contemporaries in inspiration,&mdash;he was
neither a Lasso nor a Palestrina,&mdash;but he
had a large command of polyphonic technic.
One of his notable works was a motet, entitled
"Spem in alium non habui," written for
eight choirs of five voices each, in antiphonal
style. His best known work, however, is a
Litany and Responses. His pupil, William
Byrd (born about 1538, died July 4, 1623),
wrote many admirable church works notable
for the majesty of their style. Orlando Gibbons
(died 1625, at the end of the Netherlands
period) was the last great light of the
English school.</p>

<p>During the whole period of church counterpoint,
which never lost the radical elements
of its character until after Legrenzi's day,
music felt the influence of the old chant and
the early study of the canonic style. In concluding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the account of this period, I cannot
do better than to quote a few luminous sentences
from the admirable "Evolution of the
Art of Music" by Dr. C. H. H. Parry: "Of
definite principles of design beyond this elementary
device [the canon] these composers
had but few. Their treatment of musical
figures and melodic material is singularly
vague. The familiar modern practice of using
a definite subject [part of a distinct tune]
throughout a considerable portion of a movement,
or at certain definite points which have
a structural importance, was hardly employed
at all. The voices, which entered one after
another, naturally commenced singing the
same words to phrases of melody which resembled
each other. But composers' ideas
of identity of subject matter were singularly
elastic, and even if the first half-dozen notes
presented similar contours in each voice part
successively, the melodic forms soon melted
into something else, and from that point the
movement wandered on its devious way without
further reference to its initial phrases."
This points to one of the fundamental differences
between the music of the polyphonic
era and that of the monophonic, in which
one voice or instrumental part (as the treble
of a piano) uttered a melody full of periodical
repetitions of the germinal tune-thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and the other parts supplied an accompaniment
of chords. This style of composition
was developed first in the opera and afterward
by instruments. It will be more convenient
to take up the progress of instrumental
music first, and at the outset let us review
the evolution of the piano.</p>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Plucking and striking strings&mdash;The dulcimer&mdash;Invention of
the keyboard&mdash;The clavichord and its action&mdash;Manner

<p class="cap">THE piano, like all our contemporaneous
musical instruments, is the
result of a long development. Its fundamental
principle is the setting of a stretched
string in vibration by a blow, the vibrations
acting upon the air so as to produce sound.
A subsidiary principle (subsidiary because
common to all stringed instruments, such as
violins, harps, or guitars) is the shortening
or lengthening of a string in order to obtain
a higher or a lower note. In the piano, the
application of this principle gives us a number
of strings of different lengths. In the
violin we have only four strings, but the
length of the vibrating part is altered by
pressing down the strings at different points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with the fingers of the left hand. Before
the idea of setting strings in vibration with
a bow was conceived, they were plucked
with the fingers, as in the case of the harp
and the guitar, and it is probable that this
is the oldest method of causing strings to
sound. The Hebrew <i>kinnor</i>, the first musical
instrument mentioned in the Bible
(called "harp," Genesis iv. 21), was either
a lyre or a small harp, and, according to
Josephus, it was played with a plectrum,
a small piece of ivory or steel, used to pluck
the strings. Egyptian pictures of great antiquity
show players using their fingers upon
harp strings. At the same time the Egyptians
were well acquainted with the principle
of dividing a string by pressing upon it with
the fingers of the left hand, as is proved by
their pictures of lute players.</p>

<p>But the use of a blow to set a string in
vibration was also known in very early
times. The instrument called a dulcimer,
which is always seen now in Hungarian orchestras,
is almost as old as the harp. It
consists of a number of strings stretched
across a shallow box, which acts as a resonator,
and set in vibration by two little hammers
in the hands of the player. It was
this instrument which suggested the hammer
action, and it is this action which makes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
fundamental difference between the piano
and its immediate precursors. An instrument
similar to the dulcimer was the citole, the
chief difference being that the strings were
plucked with the fingers. Add the principle
of stopping the strings with the fingers of
the left hand, and the citole becomes the
zither. In Lydgate's "Reson and Sensualité
(circa 1430) "cytolys" are enumerated
among other instruments.</p>

<p>The first important step toward the evolution
of the pianoforte was the invention
of the keyboard. The origin of this important
part of the instrument is uncertain. It
is probable that it was first applied to the
organ. At any rate, it is said that a keyboard
of sixteen keys was attached to an
organ built in the Cathedral of Magdeburg
at the close of the eleventh century, while
most historians date the clavichord or the
clavicytherium two centuries later. It is
possible, however, that some sort of rude
arrangement of keys was employed in the
monochord, an instrument used for measuring
the scientific intervals between notes of
different pitch. It is said to have been
invented by Pythagoras in the sixth century
before Christ. It consisted of an oblong
box with one string stretched across it, and
a movable bridge for dividing (or stopping)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the string at different points. The continual
shifting of the bridge was very troublesome,
and as early as the second century
(according to Claudius Ptolomæus and
Aristides Quintilianus) there was a four-stringed
instrument called a helicon. It is
surmised that the famous teacher Guido
d'Arezzo (born about 995) was the first to
use the monochord in teaching singing, and
that he devised some kind of a keyboard,
because in one of his writings he advises
his pupils "to practise the hand in the use
of the monochord."</p>

<p>The keyboard having been invented,
whether for monochord or organ, its application
to stringed instruments of the dulcimer
or citole family naturally followed. It
is impossible to tell whether the first action
was a plucking or a striking one, for there
are no records, and it is easily conceivable
that both may have been used simultaneously
in different places. Guido's action is
supposed to have consisted of a straight
lever with a bridge on the inner end. When
the outer end, the key, was struck the
bridge arose, gave the string a blow which
set it in vibration, and remaining pressed
against the string, divided it and determined
its pitch. This subsequently became the
action of the German clavichord. Another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
action consisted of a similar straight lever
with a piece of quill protruding from the
inner end. When the outer end was pressed
down the inner end moved past the string
and the quill plucked it, causing it to vibrate.
This became the action of the clavicytherium,
which some writers, without
good ground, say was antecedent to the
clavichord, and subsequently of the Italian
spinet, the harpsichord, and the virginal.</p>

<p>The first mention of the clavichord and
harpsichord is found in the "Rules of the
Minnesingers," by Eberhard Cersne, <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>
1404. The celebrated musical theorist, Jean
de Muris, of the University of Paris, writing
in 1323, and enumerating musical
instruments, mentions the four-stringed
monochord, but says nothing of the clavichord
or harpsichord. This gives reasonable
ground for the inference that those instruments
were either not invented at that time
or had so recently appeared that they were
not yet known in Paris, then the centre of
musical culture. We are quite safe in assuming
that both instruments date from the
thirteenth century, and as they were the
immediate ancestors of the piano, we must
give them especial attention. The famous
collection of Mr. Morris Steinert, of New
Haven, contains examples in good working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
order of all the different kinds of clavichords,
harpsichords, spinets, and early pianos, and
it has been my privilege to examine and
play upon all these instruments, thus obtaining
a singularly effective object lesson in the
history of the piano. The clavichord was
always built in oblong shape, like our square
piano. The keyboard was precisely like
that now used, except that some builders
made the naturals black and the sharps and
flats white. The principle of the action remained
that of the old monochord. The
key was pivoted just inside of the front
board of the case, and consisted of a single
straight shaft of wood. On the inner end
was a thin, slablike upright of brass, called a
"tangent." When the player struck the
outer end of the key, the tangent was driven
upward against the string, causing it to
vibrate. The tangent also acted as a bridge,
and divided the string into two unequal parts,
the longer of which gave out the tone. The
shorter section was prevented from sounding
by a narrow band of cloth interlaced with
the strings at that end of the instrument.
This band also acted as a damper, and caused
the whole string to cease vibrating the moment
the tangent was lowered. Clavichords
made before 1725 (or about that year) had
fewer strings than keys. One string had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
produce two and sometimes three tones.
This was accomplished by the use of the
tangents, which divided the string at different
lengths, as the violinist does with the fingers
of his left hand. These instruments were
known as "gebunden," or bound.</p>

<p>About 1725 Daniel Faber of Crailsheim
made instruments with one string for each
tone, and such clavichords were called
"bundfrei" (bound free) or "ungebunden"
(unbound). In the latest clavichords each
note had two strings tuned in unison,&mdash;a
contrivance which gained power at the expense
of some of the lovely expressiveness
of the instrument.</p>

<p>The reader will understand that, as the
clavichord string ceased sounding as soon
as the tangent was permitted to drop by
lifting the finger from the key, the method
of playing it was different from that employed
for the piano. A hard blow was of no
use; it only twanged the string disagreeably.
Pressure, with its direct communication of
the finger-touch to the string, was the secret
of clavichord playing, and it was this which
made the instrument so beautifully responsive
to the thought of the performer. By
forcing the pressure a little a sort of <i>portamento</i>
effect could be obtained, and by causing
the finger to shake up and down on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the pressed key one could get a faint and
pathetic tremolo from the vibrating string.
This effect the Germans called "bebung,"
and it was one of the most familiar graces of
clavichord playing. No one who has played
upon a clavichord can fail to see how thoroughly
the instrument works its way into
the confidence and love of an artist, and
there is no room for wonder that it was the
intimate friend of the great Bach.</p>

<p>It is difficult to arrive at satisfactory conclusions
from the statements of early writers
in regard to instruments of the harpsichord
family. Scaliger, born in 1484, says that
Simius, who lived in the last period of Greek
music, invented the Simicon. In this the
tone was produced by tangents, which were
subsequently armed with crow quills to pluck
the strings. Adriano Banchieri, in his "Conclusioni
nel suono dell' organo" (Boulogne,
1608), said that the spinet, one form of harpsichord,
was invented by Giovanni Spinetti,
and took its name from him. Banchieri
had seen such an instrument with the inscription,
"Joannes Spinetus Venetus fecit, <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>
1503." But the fact that De Muris enumerated
the instruments of his time without
naming the harpsichord or any of its kindred,
while Cersne distinctly mentioned it in 1404,
shows that it was certainly much older than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
either Spinetti or Scaliger. Ottomarus Luscinius,
a Benedictine monk, in his "Musurgia"
(Strasburg, 1536), describes the virginal,
a square instrument, of which the strings
were plucked by plectra. Marin Mersenne,
born at Oise, in 1588, in his "De Instrumentis
Harmonicis," describes the clavicymbalum,
which, according to his figure, is the
same instrument as the spinet of Banchieri
and the virginal of Luscinius.</p>

<p>There were, indeed, several varieties of
shapes and many names for what were essentially
the same instrument. Some were
square, some were trapezoid, like our grand
piano, and some were upright, but they all
had the same plectral action and produced
the same kind of tone. It will be readily
understood that these instruments were incapable
of gradations of power. No matter
how forcibly or how gently the key was
pressed, the elasticity of the plucking quill
remained constant, and so produced just the
same amount of twang from the string.
Wooden uprights, called jacks, were placed
at the inner ends of the key levers, where
the tangents were in clavichords, and the
quills ran through them. In some instruments
pieces of hard leather were used instead
of quills. Bach was acquainted with
the harpsichord, though he always preferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the clavichord. Handel, Scarlatti, and Mozart
were all great harpsichord performers.
The instrument held its favor among musicians
for a considerable time after the introduction
of the piano, to which it finally had
to yield the supremacy.</p>

<p>The first famous harpsichord builder was
Johannes Baffo, Venice, 1574, but the most
celebrated makers were: Hans Ruckers, Antwerp,
1575; Andreas Ruckers, his son, 1614,
Tschudi and Kirkman, the English builders
of Handel's day. Kirkman built harpsichords
with two banks of keys and several
sets of strings, which were controlled by
stops similar to those of an organ. This was
an attempt to overcome the dynamic monotony
of the instrument, but I can testify
from careful trial of the fine Kirkman
harpsichords in the Steinert collection that
the attempt was not a brilliant success.
You can get an approximate idea of the
sound of a harpsichord by plucking the
strings of a modern piano with the plectrum
of a mandolin, or with a common quill
toothpick.</p>

<p>The invention which overthrew the clavichord
and the harpsichord and brought into
existence the piano was the hammer action.
For years the problem of applying the keyboard
to the principle of the dulcimer, already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
explained, had occupied the minds of instrument
builders. The solution was the work
of Bartolomeo Cristofori, born at Padua,
May 4, 1653, and it was made public in
1711. Two others claimed the honor: Gottfried
Silbermann and Christopher G. Schröter.
In 1726 Silbermann made two pianos and
showed them to Bach, who condemned them
because of their heavy touch and the weakness
of their trebles. Silbermann was discouraged,
but according to Agricola, a
contemporary writer, he worked at improvements
upon his instruments, and sold one
of them to Frederick the Great, in whose
music room it stood till 1880. It was then
examined by Bechstein, the leading German
piano maker of today, who found that it
contained the Cristofori action. The priority
of Cristofori's claims is established by an
article written by Scipione Maffei and printed
in the "Giornale dei Litterati d'Italia," in
1711, with a diagram of the inventor's
hammer action. A translation of Maffei's
article will be found in Rimbault's "The
Pianoforte." (London, 1860.) It was also
published in German in Matheson's "Musikalische
Kritik," in Hamburg, 1725, so
that the contemporaries of Silbermann and
Schröter ought to have known of Cristofori's
work. Indeed, Schröter's claim was made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
by himself in a letter written in 1738, which
appears to have been evoked by irritation at
Cristofori's glory.</p>

<p>It should be noted here that in the letters
of an instrument maker named Paliarino,
written in 1598, the instrument "piano e
forte" is twice mentioned. It has been
conjectured, and probably rightly, that this
was a harpsichord with contrivances for loud
and soft effects, for it is unlikely that even
a rude hammer action could have been in
existence more than a century before Cristofori's
invention. It is, however, probable
that some attempts were made before his,
for his was altogether too satisfactory to
have been anything but the result of a
development. Nevertheless it was the first
hammer action of permanent value, and its
essential principles are employed in the finest
actions of today. Therefore Cristofori
fairly deserves the honor of inventing the
piano. The instrument, however, did not
gain great favor in Italy, owing to the inability
of the harpsichord players to acquire
the right touch, and it soon fell into disuse.
Silbermann, however, following the details
of Maffei's letter before-mentioned, built
pianos, and other German makers, notably
Friederici of Gera, who is said to have made
the first square piano, followed his lead. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
least as early as 1766 Johannes Zumpe built
square pianos in England.</p>

<p>It would fill a volume to narrate the history
of the successive steps in the development
of the piano since the days of Zumpe.
It is possible, however, to point out a few
of the important steps. The famous maker,
John Andrew Stein, Augsburg, was a pupil
of Silbermann, and was born in 1728. He
left a son, Andrew, also a maker, and
a daughter, Nanette, who became Mrs.
Streicher, and was the head of a great piano
house in Vienna. The elder Stein's pianos
were admired by Mozart, while Nanette
Streicher's pianos were used by Beethoven.
Before the time of the elder Stein the forte
and piano effects, which gave the instrument
its name, and which were then as now, produced
by the action of the dampers, were
obtained by operating "two iron springs,
ornamented with copper knobs, in that part
of the chest nearest the bass. In order to
move these springs it was necessary that the
player should use his left hand, and consequently
he was obliged for a moment to quit
the keyboard. Stein improved these springs
by making them act by means of knobs
placed against the knees." The modern
pedals are first found in John Broadwood's
patent of 1783. The pedals have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
much improved since that time, and have
played a very conspicuous part in the development
of piano playing and of piano music.
The "loud" pedal, as it is commonly called,
is less used by pianists to gain force than to
prolong sound, which before its invention
could only be done by keeping the keys
pressed down. With the dampers raised by
the "loud" pedal, the strings struck continue
to vibrate, while the fingers are free to go
on striking other keys. This enables pianists
to do far more than they could in early
times in the way of producing sustained tones
and modulations of harmony, and hence composers
for the instrument are able to write
passages which would formerly have been
impossible.</p>

<p>Double, and even triple, stringing had
been introduced in clavichords, and was continued
in pianos. The elder Stein invented
the shifting of the keyboard which causes
the hammer to strike only one string instead
of three. This contrivance is used by some
of the best makers of the present day.
Stein also improved the "escapement," the
arrangement by which the hammer falls
back the instant it has struck the string, and
this, with other features of the action, was
further developed by Streicher, so that the
Viennese pianos became famous for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
extreme lightness of their touch, and music
written by composers in that part of the
world was designed to meet this quality.
The English pianos, meanwhile, were built
with heavier strings and a deeper fall of the
hammer, so that greater sonority was attainable,
and composers wrote for them bold
passages in successions of heavy chords,
which would have gone for nothing on a
Viennese piano. At the very outset Cristofori
had to shift the pins to which the wires
were attached, from the soundboard, which
would not stand the strain, to a separate
rail. It became necessary to brace the
whole interior with steel arches, of whose
inventor there is no record, but Broadwood
was the first to introduce the method
now employed. Sebastien Érard, a celebrated
French maker, introduced many
improvements in the action and devised
what was called then the "celeste" pedal, by
which the hammers struck a strip of leather
interposed between them and the strings.
The leather is now replaced by felt. The
iron frame, now replaced by steel and found
in all fine pianos, was invented by Alpheus
Babcock of Boston in 1825. Frederick W.
C. Bechstein, of Berlin, in 1855 combined
iron frames and the powerful English action
in his instruments, and took a commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
position. The upright piano was patented
Feb. 12, 1800, by John Isaac Hawkins of
Philadelphia. Subsequent developments in
the piano have been of too wide a range to
be mentioned in the space at my command,
and at any rate have all been in the nature
of improvements,&mdash;highly important, indeed,
but without radical departure from the
fundamental features of the instruments.</p>

<p>A few words, however, must be said on
the subject of equal temperament. Previous
to the time of Bach and Jean Philippe
Rameau, the scale of the piano was arranged
according to the laws of acoustics. It is
impossible to enter into this fully, but the
result was that a piano could not be tuned
to play in all the twenty-four keys. This is
difficult to explain, but I shall endeavor to
make it clear. The pitch of a tone is determined
by the number of vibrations it makes
in a second, and it follows that there must
be a regular ratio of increase in the number
of vibrations of the notes of a scale as we
proceed upward. This establishes the scientific
basis of the scale. Now, any one who
is at all acquainted with the piano knows
that the same black key is struck to produce
either C sharp or D flat. But this has been
true only since Bach's day. Previous to
that time instruments were timed according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
to the scientific laws, and by these we find
that the C of the third octave has 256 vibrations,
the C sharp 266.66, and the D flat
276.48. Thus D flat is a higher note than
C sharp, and scientifically requires a differently
tuned string and a separate key. The
same trouble confronts us with most other
notes, so that "theory requires no less than
seventy-two keys to the octave in order that
the musician may have complete command
over all the keys employed in modern
music."</p>

<p>In order to reduce the octave to twelve
semitones with twelve keys and to make
the sharps and flats agree, as they do now,
the system of equal temperament deliberately
puts out of tune every interval except the
octave. By slightly lowering some and raising
others, the present scale was obtained.
Its advantage is that it makes it practicable
to play in all twenty-four keys, and because
of the identity of the sharps and flats it
becomes easy to modulate from one key to
another. For instance, C sharp, which is
the distinguishing note of the scale of D
major, is also D flat, and thus it becomes
easy to modulate from D to D flat, which
leads to G flat, a very remote key. This
gives the modern composer immense freedom
of style, and adds greatly to the key complexity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of music, whereas, before the adoption
of the system of equal temperament,
composers had to confine themselves to a
few closely related keys.</p>

<p>Who invented the system of equal temperament,
no one knows. It is mentioned
in the "Harmonic Universelle" of Marin
Mersenne, the French writer before quoted,
but it is quite certain that it was not extensively
employed before the time of Bach,
who brought the system to practical perfection,
and demonstrated it in his "Well-Tempered
Clavichord," a set of twenty-four
preludes and fugues going through all the
keys. The science of equal temperament
was first set forth in a satisfactory manner
by Jean Philippe Rameau, the French opera
composer, in his "Traité de l'Harmonie,"
Paris, 1722.</p>

playing and the use of the thumb&mdash;Bach's fingering
and Mozart's vocal playing&mdash;Development of

<p class="cap">THE origin of piano music, and, indeed,
of much of the entire mass of modern
instrumental music, was the organ compositions
of the early masters. The early clavichords
were used almost exclusively for the
home practice of organists; and even after it
became fashionable for young ladies to learn
the art of playing, there was no difference
whatever between the style of music written
for the organ and of that composed for the
clavichord, nor in the manner of playing either
instrument. Every musician knows that in
our time the kind of touch used for the organ
is essentially different from that used for the
piano, and that music suitable for one instrument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
is not suitable for the other. But it
was not thus in the earliest days; for the only
professional pianists (or clavichordists, to be
more precise) were the organists, and instrumental
music had not yet reached a state of
development high enough to produce a divergence
of styles. The fact that the same keyboard
was used in both instruments was
sufficient to suggest to the early organists
that one style of playing was practicable for
both. It naturally did not occur to them to
write different sorts of music; and it is necessary,
therefore, for us to inquire what was the
nature of the early organ music.</p>

<p>We have already seen that when the organ
was first introduced into the church it was
employed simply to play the same notes as
the voices sang. This practice naturally suggested
to composers a style for their organ
music when they began to write for the organ
independently of the voices. Just when they
began to do that it is not possible to say,
because the early compositions have not been
preserved as the great masterpieces of church
counterpoint have. The first organist of
repute whose name has come down to us was
Francesco Landini, of Venice. He flourished
about 1364. But we do not meet with any
definite school of organists in Venice until
the third period of the Netherlands school,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
when the great Adrian Willaert was the leading
master. In 1547 was published a collection
of music entitled "Ricercari da cantare
e sonare," by Jacob Buus. These "ricercari"
were compositions in the old ecclesiastical
keys and the polyphonic style. "Da
cantare e sonare" means that they were to be
sung or played. Anything "cantata" was
vocal, anything "sonata" was instrumental;
and so after a time they began to call a
composition for instruments alone a sonata,
though it was a very different sort of work
from a sonata by Mozart. In 1549 fantasies
for three voices, vocal or instrumental, by
Willaert were printed. Willaert used original
themes in his fantasies, and his style shows a
gradual approach to the modern manner.
In 1551 was issued a collection by various
authors, entitled "A New Collection of Various
Kinds of Dances to be Played on the
Harpsichord, Clavicimbal, Spinet, or Monochord."
The word "dances" is very significant,
because it shows the first recorded effort
to write instrumental music in purely instrumental
form. In this collection there was
no polyphony, but the melody of the dance
was in the treble, and the bass was a simple
chord accompaniment. This is an evidence
of the manner in which the music of the
people began at that early date to influence
compositions for instruments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>But the dominion of church counterpoint
was not to be overthrown at once; and so
we find that the first clearly defined instrumental
form was the "toccata." Those of
Claudio Merulo, a Venetian organist, printed
in 1598, were the first to be published. They
were written for the organ, and resembled
Willaert's church vocal music in that they
consisted of running or polyphonic passages,
followed by successions of broad chords.
Giovanni Gabrieli did more, perhaps, than
any other of the Venetians to lead instrumental
music toward the modern style. He
wrote what he called "canzone;" and in
these compositions the melody assumed a
position of importance. Furthermore, he
showed a tendency to make his melodic
themes recur at regular intervals, although he
had no well-defined system. Still, he made
important advances. The Roman school of
organists made valuable contributions to the
development of instrumental music. Girolamo
Frescobaldi (1591-1640) wrote ricercari
in which there was something like a systematic
employment of clear melodic themes.
He wrote canzone in which there were passages
slightly resembling the choral hymns
of the Reformation; and in his "Capriccio
Chromatico" he made a bold use of chromatic
harmonies. Indeed, his music shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
a general tendency toward the modern major
and minor keys. We are not surprised, then,
to find in the works of Bernardo Pasquine
(1637-1710) arpeggios (running passages
composed of the notes of chords, much used
in modern piano music), flowing passages for
both hands, and repetitions of the thematic
ideas. But the manner of composing for
the clavichord and harpsichord had been so
greatly influenced at this time by the evolution
of a distinct method of playing the instruments
that we must, before advancing any
further, go back and briefly review that topic.</p>

<p>The first systematic method of playing the
organ and harpsichord was set forth in 1593
in a book by Girolamo di Ruta, a Venetian,
and it contained rules for fingering which were
in use for more than a century. A work by
Lorenzo Penna, published at Bologna in
1656, shows very clearly what the general
principles of clavichord and harpsichord technic
were in that day. "In ascending the
fingers of the right hand move one after the
other,&mdash;first the middle, then the ring finger,
again the middle, and so on in alternation.
Care must be taken that the fingers do not
strike against one another. In descending,
the middle, followed by the index finger, is
used. The left hand simply reverses this
process. The rule for the position of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
hands is that they shall never lie lower than
the fingers, but shall be held high, with the
fingers stretched out." This style of fingering
held its own until Bach's time. It was in
existence as late as 1741, though more fingers
were employed. But the fingers were still
held straight, and the thumb was not used.</p>

<p>It is difficult to separate the purely musical
and the purely technical causes which led
to the abandonment of the polyphonic style
for the monophonic in piano music, and for
that reason I must state them together. The
first influence was the introduction of solo
singing in vocal music. We shall review the
history of that when we take up opera. It is
sufficient at present to say that before 1600
all vocal music written by the art composers
was in the ecclesiastical polyphonic style, and
that the single-voiced song with accompaniment
entered vocal music at the end of the
sixteenth century. The influence of this new
element made itself felt in instrumental music
at once. We have noticed already that in
Giovanni Gabrieli's works the melody assumed
a new importance, and this importance
constantly increased. The second cause
was the full establishment of the difference
between piano and organ technic. This was
chiefly due to Domenico Scarlatti (1683-1757).
It was in his day that the system of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
equal temperament was made known, though
it may be doubted whether he lived long
enough after its publication in those times of
slow communication to profit by it. But he
certainly did profit by the high state of excellence
to which the manufacture of harpsichords
had advanced. And he was greatly
influenced by the operatic works of his father,
Alessandro, in which the simple aria was the
chief element of attraction. Domenico naturally
endeavored to imitate the general form
and melodic fluency of the aria in his sonatas,
and in doing this he developed a harpsichord
style of much beauty. He introduced many
technical features which are purely modern,
such as the execution of runs in double notes
(thirds and sixths), the rapid repetition of the
same note by striking it with different fingers
in succession, and running arpeggios with
both hands in opposite directions. Such feats
were not called for by the polyphonic music,
but the new style of writing made a great
use of passages built on the successive notes
of the scale, and to execute these a new manner
of playing had to be evolved. In evolving
it the musicians discovered new feats, and
these in turn took their place in the compositions
of the time.</p>

<p>In fact the development of the instrument
itself affected the development of the technics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of playing, and these affected the evolution of
piano music. Then the music itself reacted
on the technic, and this made new demands
of the instrument makers. We have seen
that when the early pianists set about the
formulation of rules for playing their instruments
they made poor work of it. Their
rules were arbitrary and were not evolved
from a study of the natural action of the
hand. Smooth running of scale passages
with such rules as those of Lorenzo Penna
could be accomplished only at a very moderate
pace. The old polyphonic compositions
for the clavichord and harpsichord demanded
of the player a technic which would enable
him to bring out clearly the three or four
voice parts. The new style, which borrowed
so much from vocal music, naturally sought
for a smooth, flowing, even performance, in
which the instrument should, as nearly as
possible, sing like a solo voice with accompaniment.
Emmanuel Bach, who wrote an
important book on clavichord playing, proclaimed
his belief that the singing style was
the only true one for the instrument. These
early musicians had, indeed, arrived at the
heart of the matter, for the highest achievement
of piano technic today is the preservation
of a pure singing tone throughout the
intricacies of modern music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
The discovery of the value of the thumb
revolutionized clavichord and harpsichord
playing. George Frederick Handel (1685-1759)
and François Couperin (1668-1733)
both made free use of the thumb, but it was
Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) who
systematized its employment. He decided
that the old position of the hand with the
back flat and the fingers stretched to their
full extent was unnatural. He saw that the
whole strength of the fingers could not be
brought to bear while they were in this position,
and that the thumb could not be placed
upon the keyboard at all. When he attempted
to use his thumb, he had to raise
the back of his hand and bend his fingers,
and this he saw at once placed the whole hand
in a position of command over the keyboard
which it had never before possessed. He
therefore rearranged the fingering of all the
scales, introducing the system which still continues
in use. Bach himself discovered that
with his new system of fingering he could
play polyphonic or monophonic music with
equal ease, and hence we find that his compositions
abound in both kinds of writing.
He himself, being a church composer, naturally
clung to the ecclesiastic style, and in his
great organ and piano fugues transferred the
whole contrapuntal science of the fifteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and sixteenth centuries to instrumental music.
But we shall see that better when we come
to a consideration of the music apart from
the technic and the style.</p>

<p>The singing style of playing was further developed
by the immortal Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart (1756-1791). The instrument on
which he played was the harpsichord, and the
evenness of its tone encouraged his natural
predilection for a vocal style. Mozart was
a master of writing for singers, as is shown
by his operas, and he readily saw his way to
preserving the vocal manner in his playing
of the harpsichord and his compositions for
it. He held that a good pianist should
have a perfect legato style (legato means
"bound," and legato style is that in which
the notes flow smoothly one into the other)
a singing touch and a manner without affectation.
Mozart did not live long enough
to benefit much from the growing acquaintance
with the newly invented piano, but one
of his contemporaries, who outlived him by
more than two-score years did so. This
was Muzio Clementi (1752-1832), a man of
no genius in composition, but of exceptional
capacity for the reception of suggestions
from his instrument. Clementi's mind appears
to have been largely occupied with the
problem of the possibilities of the piano. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
he was not wholly devoted to the development
of power and rapidity, for after a
memorable meeting with Mozart he cultivated
the singing style more assiduously
than he had previously. He lived through
a period of vital growth in music, for he was
a contemporary of Haydn, Mozart, Weber
and Beethoven. It would have been strange
had he been insensible to the productions of
such an era. In his youth, and indeed
through most of his life he lived in England,
and there he formed his early style on the
English piano, which had thick strings, a
heavy touch and a deep hammer fall. The
result was that his music abounded in bold
and brilliant passages of octaves, thirds, and
sixths. He aimed at a sonorous and imposing
musical diction, and he demanded of a
pianist great physical power. Clementi's
piano technic was the first which was clearly
differentiated from that of the harpsichord
and his "Gradus ad Parnassum" (1817) a
series of 100 studies, remains to this day the
foundation of solid piano playing. Many
things have since been added to piano
technic, but Clementi's rules lie at the base
of it.</p>

<p>The works of Beethoven, to which more
extended attention will be given hereafter,
introduced nothing strictly new in the technic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of piano playing, but they did compel
certain changes in style. Beethoven wrote
often in a new kind of polyphony, more
free and striking than that of the early composers
for the clavichord and harpsichord,
and very much more difficult. This new
polyphony was made practicable by the
technics of Clementi, but it required an
attention on the part of the pianist to the
enunciation of the several voice parts not
required by Clementi's music. Again Beethoven
displayed great originality in the treatment
of musical rhythms, and the proper
accentuation of notes having unexpected
emphases required unusual independence of
finger. This independence was highly developed
by Beethoven's successors, and at
the present day is absolutely indispensable
to piano playing. But the most important
demand of Beethoven's piano music was
dramatic style. His music, as we shall see
later, was the first outside of opera in which
the expression of passion was sought, and
this expression required that the pianist
should have at his command a great range
of force, from the gentlest pianissimo to the
most imposing fortissimo, and a wide variety
of what is called tone-color. This tone-color
means quality of instrumental tone,
and in a piano it is capable of many changes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
hard or soft, sweet or harsh, melting or icy,
as the necessities of the music require.</p>

<p>Beethoven, having departed by reason of
the dramatic nature of his music, from the
continually smooth legato of Mozart, paved
the way for Weber, Chopin, Schumann, and
Liszt to develop the highest powers of expression
in the piano. To do this they had
to carry variety of touch to its present state
of progress and to evolve the modern use
of the pedals, for tone-color is produced by
different combinations of touch and pedalling.
Weber imparted a new and joyous
brilliancy to piano music, and much of his
music requires a luxuriant richness of color.
Beethoven had begun to make use of the
pedals and in his last piano sonatas explicit
directions are given for their use. Weber's
music requires still more extended employment
of them, but it was Chopin who systematized
their use and showed how to get
varieties of tone-color by employing them
separately or in combination. Again, Chopin
remodelled the Bach system of fingering by
adapting some of the early methods to
modern music. It is quite common now
in certain kinds of passages to pass the third
finger over the little one of the right hand
or the little one under the third. Chopin
wrote new kinds of passages of great beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
which cannot be played without resorting to
this expedient and to others introduced by
him.</p>

<p>Schumann added more to piano playing
by writing in a very original style. His
rhythms are very much involved, he treats
accompaniments in an unusual manner, and
he writes "interlocking" passages, in which
both hands have to participate. To play
Schumann's music well, a pianist must go
through a special series of exercises to fit his
hands for the work. Finally Liszt, who
felt that the piano was as capable an instrument
as the orchestra, if rightly treated,
gave us the present development of the
varieties of touch. He wrote studies designed
to give pianists the most complete
independence of finger,&mdash;a very necessary
thing in modern piano music, in which very
often two fingers of one hand may be engaged
in enunciating a melody while the
other three are assisting in the accompaniment.
Liszt showed us the immense value
of the loose wrist, without which the velvety
quality of tone produced, when required, by
such pianists as himself, Rubinstein, and
Paderewski, is quite unattainable. Liszt
taught his pupils to hold the wrist high,
but more recent players use either a high
or a low position accordingly as they desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
sonority and brilliancy or mellowness and
gentleness.</p>

<p>The whole development of piano playing
has, of course, gone hand in hand with that
of piano music, and that has followed the
course of music in general. It becomes
necessary, then, for us now to review the
evolution of piano music. We have seen
how it grew out of organ playing and was at
first polyphonic. We have seen how the
monophonic style&mdash;the melody with accompaniment&mdash;came
in. We must now try to
see how the polyphonic style worked itself
out in the great compositions of Bach, and
how the monophonic style developed itself
in a new and highly organized form, the
sonata, whose fundamental principles lie at
the basis of all modern composition.</p>

<h3>Climax of the Polyphonic Piano Style</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">The development of the instrumental fugue&mdash;What is a
fugue?&mdash;Its combination of polyphony with development of
a theme&mdash;Johann Sebastian Bach and his organ and clavichord
fugues&mdash;Fundamental traits of this music.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">WHEN instrumental music began to
develop independently it naturally
followed the lines already followed by vocal
music. That had been wholly contrapuntal,
and instrumental music was at first entirely
polyphonic. In its development the art of
music inevitably fashioned certain forms, for
no art can exist without form, which is the
external demonstration of design. Without
design there is no art. Musicians very soon
learned that the first principle of form in
music was repetition. A phrase of melody
once heard and never repeated is quickly
forgotten. A dozen different phrases in succession
would not make a recognizable tune.
The germinal part of the tune has to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
heard often, and there must be a beginning,
a middle and an end. For example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music123.mid">Listen: Germinal, Middle, Germinal, End</a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/music123.png" width="400" height="154" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><a href="images/music123x.png">View Larger Image Here.</a></div>
</div>

<p class="center small">[|--germinal part--|--middle--|--germinal part--|--end--|]</p>

<p>Now this is a melody in the pure song form,
such as the earliest popular music contained.
But the church composers, the only scientific
musicians of the early day, in ignoring that
form, as we have seen, developed a scheme
of repetition of the identifying parts of their
tunes by making the different voices sing
them at different times. And this scheme
evolved the art of polyphonic writing, which
we have seen developed so beautifully by the
Netherlands masters and the early Italian
church composers. The reader will remember
that the principle which lies at the foundation
of polyphonic writing is "imitation."
After instrumental music began to develop
independently it clung for a time to the
forms based on imitation, but when the vocal
style became dominant in Italy, owing to the
enormous popularity of the opera, imitation
and its forms fled into Germany, where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
found their highest embodiment in instrumental
music in the North German fugue.
The fugue is the most complex and highly
organized polyphonic form we have, and it
is necessary that the reader should know
something of its construction.</p>

<p>A fugue has been defined as "a musical
composition developed, according to certain
rules of imitation, from a short theme or
phrase called the subject. This subject is
from time to time reproduced by each of the
two, three, four, or more parts or voices for
which the fugue is written." The subject,
then, is a definite theme, of from four to
eight measures, from which the fugue is
developed. The next essential part is the
answer. This is the first appearance of the
subject in one of the subsidiary voices. This
appearance is always in the dominant key,
and usually has its last notes changed so as
to make an ending. The counter-subject is
that part of the theme of the first voice which
forms the accompaniment to the answer. The
announcement of these parts of the fugue is
called the exposition. After the exposition
the composer works up the melodic ideas of
his material in passages of double counterpoint,
free imitation, and various other polyphonic
devices, all distributed so as to give
interest and variety to the fugue, until he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
reaches the stretto, a portion in which by ingenious
changes he brings out a climax, after
which he may add a coda (tail-piece) and
come to an end. Here is an example by Sir
Frederic A. Gore-Ouseley:&mdash;</p>

<p>The reader will see at once that the exposition
part of a fugue is built on the principles
of double counterpoint, and that it is in its
essentials the same kind of music as that
written by the Netherlands masters for voices
to sing in church. The distinguishing part
of the fugue is the working out of the
thematic ideas by devices suitable solely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
instrumental music with its freedom from
text, the development of a climax, and the
restatement of the original ideas before closing.
It is in this well ordered discussion of
musical ideas which have been laid down
as primary propositions, that we find the
immense advance of the fugue as an intellectual
form over the polyphonic works of
Lasso or Palestrina. I have already quoted
Dr. Parry's statement that those writers
rarely employed the "modern practice of
using a definite subject throughout a considerable
portion of a movement." This
practice is at the foundation of all modern
instrumental music, and its first complete
systematization was reached in the fugues of
Bach. Scarlatti and others were developing
the principle in its application to monophonic
music, but Bach, clinging to the
polyphonic style, which was already far more
advanced than the monophonic, and having
a singularly deep insight into the soul of
his art, attained perfection in the application
of the new and vital principle to contrapuntal
composition while the monophonic
sonata was yet in its infancy.</p>

<p>The authoritative biography of the father
of modern music is "The Life of Bach," by
Dr. Philip Spitta, of Berlin. An excellent
English translation is published. Johann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Sebastian Bach, a member of a family
devoted to music through several generations,
was born at Eisenach, in March, 1685.
He received his early instruction from one
of his brothers. His life was almost devoid
of incident. He served as organist and
concert-master in Arnstadt, Mülhausen,
Weimar, and Anhalt-Koethen. He became
cantor of the Thomas School in Leipsic in
1723, and retained that post till his death,
July 28, 1750. In every department of
music known to his time Bach demonstrated
that he was a genius of the highest order.
He is regarded as the most excellent of all
models for students of composition because
his works combine, in the highest beauty,
originality of melodic ideas with profundity
of design. His mastery of the formal material
of his art enabled him to imbue the
severest form, such as the fugue, with grace,
beauty, and expressiveness. His melodic
diction is not of the kind popular with the
masses, and his music today is enjoyed only
by those who truly love the best. But it is
always played by artists and orchestras of
high rank, and will continue to be heard
probably for centuries.</p>

<p>Bach was a master of composition for the
organ, for the clavichord, for the orchestra,
for the solo voice, and for chorus. It is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
possible in a book like this to give detailed
consideration to his works. His famous
settings of "The Passion" will be noticed
in their proper place, and so will the influence
of his orchestral compositions. At
present we are to review briefly his piano
compositions, which were written for the
clavichord. This, perhaps, is one of the
most remarkable features of these great
works. Played on a modern piano, with all
its power and brilliancy, they seem to be
perfectly suited to it. The clavier compositions
of Bach consist of "inventions," suites,
preludes, fugues, sonatas, concertos, and
fantasias. In his "Well-Tempered Clavichord,"
already mentioned, Bach left us a
set of preludes and fugues which have never
been surpassed. He also left us a treatise,
"The Art of Fugue," in which the laws of
the form are illustrated by sixteen fugues and
four canons for one piano, and two fugues
for two pianos all on the same theme.</p>

<p>Bach's organ toccatas and fugues grew
directly out of the old style introduced by
Merulo and the Venetian masters. They
sought to bring out the power and variety
of their instrument by contrasting chord
passages of breadth and majesty with scale
passages of brilliant character. Bach systematized
this style of composition by showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
how to produce contrast and variety while
developing logically by the devices of
counterpoint a definite subject and working
up to a climax of great eloquence. In his
works for the clavichord he demonstrated the
same principle of subject and development,
but in a style adapted to the nature of the
instrument. His preludes and fugues are
amazing not only in the extent of their mastery
of the technics of composition, but also
in their almost prophetic insight into the
possibilities of the piano as a means of expression.
All these preludes and fugues
have a note of personal intimacy. Some are
playful, some are bold, some are sad, some
are full of celestial calm, some are passionately
pathetic. The higher qualities of these
compositions are their consistency, their
sense of fitness, their apparent inevitableness.
The subject of a Bach piano fugue
not only suggests the answer and the logical
development, but it fixes the character of
the musical mood of the composition. The
harmonies, the changes of key, the action
and reaction of the imitative passages in
double counterpoint, all are not only marvellous
in their exhibition of technical skill, but
all are of such a nature that they sustain and
expound the feeling contained in the subject.
It is this mastership of artistic organization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that places the music of Sebastian Bach
above that of all his contemporaries, all of
his predecessors, and most of his successors.
He moulded the rigid materials of canonic
art, which held earlier composers in its
grasp, to his own ends and left us instrumental
polyphonic works which have never
been equalled and which are still the fountainheads
of our musical learning.</p>

<p>It ought to be noted that his own perfection
of the system of equal temperament enabled
him to do much that his predecessors
could not have done, even had they possessed
his genius. By making it possible to play
in all twenty-four keys, and to modulate from
the tonic of a composition into very remote
keys, Bach introduced into instrumental polyphony
an elasticity, a pliancy, a freedom,
which it had never before possessed. He
was able to fill his polyphonic writing with
the passionate utterance of chromatic harmony;
and in his "Chromatic Fantasia and
Fugue" he produced a work which was actually
a bridge between the style that went
before him and the style that followed him.
With Bach the development of instrumental
polyphony came to an end. Nothing has
been added to its technic except the application
of the most recent laws of harmony.
Bach was ahead of his time, and music was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
working out simpler problems than his when
his work was completed. They were problems
in monophonic style, and to these we
must now turn our attention.</p>

<p class="cap">THE fundamental difference between the
sonata and the polyphonic forms is
that the sonata is written in the monophonic
style. Polyphony is, indeed, occasionally
employed, but the reigning style is that in
which a melody, song-like in character and
sung by a single part, is accompanied by
other parts written in chord harmonies. The
necessary repetition of the melodic ideas is
made, not by the process of imitation, as in
the fugue, but by what is called the cyclical
method. In this a tune or a composition
always returns to a restatement of the original
theme from which it started. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
seen how this melodic style entered instrumental
music in the days of Giovanni Gabrieli,
and how Domenico Scarlatti transferred
to the harpsichord the aria of the opera.
From this time forward the monophonic style
developed gradually from the initial impulse
of the vocal solo. Composers who had not
Bach's peculiar insight into polyphonic writing
and profound genius for it naturally
sought a form which would give their melodies
coherence and intelligibility. The rapid
development of the violin as a solo instrument
was one of the influences in directing
them along certain lines of construction. The
violin naturally lent itself to a flowing, song-like
style, yet it is easy to see how easily
such a style would fall into monotony. The
early violin composers, in their search after a
form which would embrace coherency, variety,
and contrast, did much toward assisting
piano writers to reach the true method of
composing.</p>

<p>Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713) was the
most influential of these early violin composers.
He endeavored to unite in his works
the attractive and popular features of church
music, song, and the dances of his time. The
attractiveness of making compositions out of
different kinds of dance movements in alternation
had presented itself to composers at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
an early date. Morley, in his "Plain and
Easy Introduction to Practical Music"
(1597), says: "It is effective to alternate
pavanes with galliards, because the former
are a kind of staid music ordained for grave
dancing, and the latter for a lighter and more
stirring kind of dancing." This alternation
of dances is what first suggested to composers
the plan of following a slow movement with
a lively one, or <i>vice versa</i>. As these different
kinds of dances differed in rhythm,&mdash;the
pavanes, for instance, being in common and
the galliard in triple measure,&mdash;composers
grasped the idea that changes in rhythm
would heighten the contrast between movements.
The one thing that did not seem to
be settled at the outset&mdash;and that was due
to the newness of harmonic as opposed to
polyphonic style&mdash;was the matter of key
contrasts. Sometimes these early writers put
all their dance movements in one key, making
what we now call a "suite," and sometimes
they did not.</p>

<p>Corelli wrote his sonatas most frequently
in four movements. The composers who
immediately succeeded him wrote more often
in three movements, but preserved the alternation
of rhythm and tempo. Corelli used
only one subject in each movement, and the
development of it was of a simple nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
compared to the developments found in subsequent
works. Later composers found that
in order to secure the necessary amount of
contrast and variety, together with those
points of repose which are essential to artistic
form in music, it was necessary to have two
principal themes of contrasting nature. The
development of these themes was confined to
the first movement, while the other movements
were less complex in design. The
Germans were not wholly idle in advancing
the sonata, but it is extremely difficult to
ascertain how their work and that of the
Italians affected one another. We know that
a violin sonata by H. J. F. Biber, published
in 1681, shows a well ordered sequence of
contrasting movements. The first was a very
slow one (largo), in contrapuntal style; the
second, a passacaglia (theme and variations);
the third, rhapsodical and declamatory; and
the fourth, a gavotte. Dr. Parry has pointed
out that Biber received his suggestions for
the first movement from church polyphony,
for the second and fourth from dances, and
for the third from operatic declamation. This
sonata, however, shows nothing of that methodic
repetition of subjects and definite
distribution of keys now regarded as indispensable;
and in some respects Corelli's
sonatas were of a distinctly higher type. Following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the admirable analysis of Dr. Parry,
I may state here that as early composers
gradually perceived the possibilities of the
sonata form, they evolved this scheme for
their alternation of movement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p3 small">1. Summons to attention, followed by appeal to
intelligence through display of design.<br />
2. Slow movement&mdash;appeal to the emotions.<br />
3. Finale&mdash;lively reaction after emotion.</p>

<p>This treatment of the character of the
movements grew out of the crude attempts
of the earliest writers and was formulated in
the concertos of Sebastian Bach, but more
clearly in the piano sonatas of his son Carl
Philip Emmanuel Bach. Previous to that,
however, something had been done toward
a definite arrangement of the distribution of
keys. To this Domenico Scarlatti, who has
already been mentioned, made some important
contributions. His compositions called
sonatas have a distinct melodic subject, and
this is preserved throughout. His first
movements foreshadow the shape which the
first movements of the classical sonatas subsequently
assumed. These movements are
divided plainly into two parts, and each part
is repeated. Each of them opens with an
announcement of the melodic subject in the
tonic key of the sonata. After stating his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
subject Scarlatti passes into a key closely
related to that of the sonata, and gives a bit
of what is called "passage work;" that is,
florid or ornamental piano writing without
a complete tune. The second part embarks
upon a brief musical development of the
subject by means of simple musical changes
in its original shape, then modulates back
into the original key, restates the beginning
of the movement and comes to an end.
One of the peculiarities of his works is
that sometimes in the musical development
("working out," as it is called) of his theme
he introduces a new melody, different from
the first. Later writers caught at this idea
and raised this second melody to an importance
equal to that of the first.</p>

<p>Scarlatti's great contemporary, Johann
Sebastian Bach, did not stand in the direct
line of development of the piano sonata. As
I have tried to show in writing of clavichord
works, his sympathies when composing for a
keyboard instrument were governed largely
by his immense genius for the organ and his
profound insight into the nature and scope
of polyphonic composition. Nevertheless,
his violin sonatas, the result of a close and
admiring study of those of Corelli and Vivaldi,
show a leaning toward the modern form. He
followed the lines laid down by Corelli. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
but one of his violin sonatas are in four
movements, the first and third slow, and the
second and fourth lively. The slow movements,
as one would naturally expect from
Bach, are intense in their emotional eloquence.
But Bach's manner of development
was almost always polyphonic, and this was
hostile to the sonata method, which was radically
monophonic.</p>

<p>Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach (born, Weimar,
March 14, 1714; died, Hamburg, Dec.
14, 1788), the third son of Sebastian Bach,
was by nature and artistic taste fitted for the
work which his father did not attempt. We
have already noticed his theory that one
should play the clavichord and write for it in
the singing style. It was his feeling for this
style and his keen insight into the capabilities
of his instrument which made him, though
not a composer of genius, a powerful agent
in the establishment of the modern sonata
form,&mdash;so powerful, indeed, that he has been
called the father of the sonata. We owe
something, however, to the demands of public
taste. Music-lovers have usually, with the
exception of the few, preferred the purely
sensuous beauty of music to its intellectual
qualities. They grew weary in those days of
the severity of the fugue form; and the composers
of the time naturally endeavored to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
supply them with what they desired, something
easily, rhythmically pleasing. For
years after Emmanuel Bach's day it continued
to be the aim of composers to write with
elegance and taste.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Bach excluded polyphonic writing
from his sonatas, and adopted a style
entirely monophonic. He contributed toward
the development of the sonata in the
direction of clearness and symmetry, and he
insisted upon a well-regulated contrast of
keys and of the characters of the different
movements. In short, he established the outline
of the sonata, with the exception of duality
of themes, determined the direction in
which it was to develop, and gave it a powerful
impulse. The first sonatas in which
Emmanuel Bach showed his ability were six
published in 1742, and dedicated to Frederick the Great.
<a name="FNanchor_10_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1" class="fnanchor">[10.1]</a>
The opening movement of each
is in the sonata form, as it existed then. The
principal theme is properly announced, there
is a short section of "working out," and a
conclusion with the principal theme in the
tonic key. In the working out the composer
does not use the principal key, and
thus in returning to it in his conclusion gets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the effect of repose. In at least one of these
sonatas, the second, there is a clearly marked
second theme in the first part. There are
touches of humor here and there in these
sonatas, and some of the slow movements
are full of feeling. The finales are all light
and lively.</p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_10_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_1"><span class="label">[10.1]</span></a>
The author desires to acknowledge his indebtedness at
this particular point to "The Pianoforte Sonata," by J. S.
Shedlock.</div>

<p>Emmanuel Bach is best known by six collections
of sonatas and other compositions
published at Leipsic between 1779 and 1787.
In these sonatas the composer's resolute and
final departure from the old polyphonic style
is fully demonstrated. To enter wholly into
the monophonic method of writing was no
small undertaking, and we meet with many
evidences of effort in these works. But the
"working out" part of the sonata is always
monophonic. The composer takes passages
or phrases from his original melody, and
treating them with changes of pitch, harmonic
modulation, and bits of passage-writing,
founded on figures previously used in
the statement of the theme, he makes a
musical exposition of his original idea. This
is precisely what later composers did, but
they had better command of the monophonic
style, and hence produced better music than
Emmanuel Bach.</p>

<p>The reader should now be in a position to
understand that it is expected that at least
one of the three or four contrasting movements
of a sonata should be in what is called
sonata form. This is almost always the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
movement, in accordance with the general
design of movements already given. This
movement consists of three parts, which may
be called proposition, discussion, and conclusion.
The propositional part proposes a
theme or themes; the discussion subjects the
theme or themes to every device of musical
treatment; and the conclusion restates the
themes in their original form and brings the
movement to a restful finish. Up to the point
at which we have now arrived composers proposed,
as a rule, only one theme for discussion.
Occasionally a second was introduced,
but it seems to have been merely episodal.
We now come to the time when two themes
were employed systematically, and from that
time dates the establishment of the complete
outline of the present sonata form. All the
changes since made are in details. The composer
by whom this important work was done
was Haydn.</p>

<p>Josef Haydn was born April 1, 1732,
in Rohrau, Austria. He studied first at home
and afterward at Vienna. In 1759 he became
conductor of a small orchestra maintained by
Count Morzin, and in 1760 he married a
wigmaker's daughter, who had been his pupil.
In 1761 Haydn became conductor of the
orchestra of Prince Esterhazy at Eisenstadt,
where he remained thirty years industriously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
composing. He became acquainted with
Mozart, for whom he entertained the highest
admiration. In 1790 he visited London
and was received with great enthusiasm, so
that he made a second visit in 1794. He
died May 31, 1809, eighteen years before
the death of Beethoven, and four years before
the birth of Wagner. His music, therefore,
brings us into close connection with the present
period. His music is accessible to players
of the piano, and there are good editions
of his sonatas.</p>

<p>Haydn has been called the father of the
symphony and the string quartet, and his
most important compositions are in these
departments. But a symphony is simply a
sonata for orchestra, and a quartet is one for
four instruments. Hence we shall find that
Haydn's piano sonatas show the same advances
in form as his symphonies and
quartets. In the first movements of three
of his earliest sonatas (op. 22, 24, and 29) he
uses in the propositional part two principal
themes, wholly different from one another.
He did not, however, in the works of his
middle life follow this plan, but in his
English symphonies he used second themes
invariably and in a manner which allows no
room for doubt as to his definite purpose.
The form of his first movements is clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and symmetrical. It is in three parts, the
proposition, discussion, and conclusion being
plainly distinguished. The working out part
is shorter and simpler than those found in
later sonatas, such as Beethoven's. But
Haydn's first movements convince the hearer
of their claims to consideration as works of
art on lines of design carefully planned.
The systematic use of the second theme was
adopted by all subsequent composers, and
was the means of raising the sonata from an
experiment to the most satisfactory and convincing
of all musical forms.</p>

<p>In Haydn's three-movement sonatas the
appeal to the intelligence by the opening
allegro is always followed by an appeal to
the emotions in a slow movement, with
broad melody and harmony and much sentiment.
His finales are always bright and
lively, and frequently sparkle with gayety.
In form the finale is usually a rondo, an
early cyclical form in which a single melodic
subject is periodically repeated, the repetitions
being separated by passages of new
matter. When Haydn wrote a sonata in
four movements, he introduced as the third
the minuet, a piece of music in dance rhythm.
Emmanuel Bach had used this form in one
or two of his sonatas, but it is easy to see
that the idea was originally suggested by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
alternation of different kinds of dances in
the archaic sonatas of Biber and Corelli.
The minuet, being a graceful and elegant
dance in triple rhythm, formed a most excellent
bridge between an emotional slow movement
and a jocund finale. The minuet
movement consists, as a rule, of two parts,
called minuet and trio. In the old dance it
was customary to give relief to the first
melody by a second, always written in three-part
harmony and hence called "trio."
This plan, except the adherence to three-part
harmony, was followed by the artistic
composers when they adopted the minuet as
part of the sonata. In addition to what has
been said, two important facts must be noted.
Haydn was intimately acquainted with the
simple, fluent melody of Italian music, and
he was not acquainted with Bach's "Well-Tempered
Clavichord." The result was
that his themes are all essentially song-like
in character. They are more extended and
more definite in shape than Emmanuel
Bach's, and they helped to fix more firmly
the distinctive character of monophonic
composition.</p>

<p>After Haydn was born, and before he
died, Mozart lived. Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart was born at Salzburg, Jan. 27,
1756. He received his early tuition from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
his father, an excellent musician, and speedily
developed into a "wonder child." He
made several tours through Europe as a
pianist, but finally settled in Vienna, where
he married and spent the remainder of his
brief life in pouring out operas, quartets,
songs, sonatas, and other compositions, some
of which were certainly made to sell, but all
of which display something of his marvellous
genius. It cannot fairly be said of Mozart
that he contributed a great deal that was
new to the mere technics of sonata writing.
Mozart had little of the spirit of the explorer,
and less of that of the reformer. He was
content to take musical forms as he found
them and instil into them a vitality which
was inseparable from serious attempts at
composition. Some of his works, indeed,
show the evil results of that fatal facility
which is a menace to art; but nearly all of
them display a fecundity of invention, a
grace and freedom of style, and a sense of
artistic elegance which did much to influence
subsequent writers.</p>

<p>Mozart's piano sonatas are worthy of the
pianist's attention, but they cannot be said
to have done anything toward the advancement
of the form which Haydn's did not.
Mozart learned the sonata form from
Haydn's works. He gave something back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to his teacher, but it was chiefly in the shape
of suggestions as to instrumental treatment,
for Mozart was a master pianist, and Haydn
was only a respectable performer. Mozart's
sonatas show wonderful cleverness in adapting
to the idiom of the piano the vocal style
of the contemporaneous Italian opera, of
which Mozart was the finest composer.
His C minor sonata, written in 1784, is his
greatest piano work. It is so fine that,
except for the comparative baldness of its
instrumental style, it ranks with the works
of Beethoven's middle period.</p>

<p>The reader must bear in mind the important
fact that instrumental music, pure and
simple, was still young, and that composers
were chiefly engaged in developing musical
beauty. The technics of instrumental writing
were not sufficiently advanced to admit
of high emotional expression. The reader
will remember that in the old schools of
church counterpoint the technics of the art
were developed by Okeghem, after which
Josquin des Prés showed how to write beautifully,
and the masters of the last period discovered
how to make beauty go hand in hand
with expression. So the early writers of the
sonata were chiefly engaged in experimenting
with the technics of their new form and the
instruments for which they wrote, and this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
paved the way for Haydn and Mozart, when
once the former had established the sonata
form, to seek for pure beauty. This they
found, and Mozart's works in particular
abound with it. The time was now at
hand when the sonata form was to be
made the vehicle for the expression of the
most profound human emotion. But before
it could achieve that end, something
had to be added to its technic and its organization.
Part of this addition was made
by Clementi.</p>

<p>Muzio Clementi (1752-1832) was born
before Beethoven and died after him. His
works show that he at first influenced Beethoven
but was afterward influenced by him.
Clementi's masculine treatment of the piano,
which we have already noticed, went far toward
leading Beethoven away from the thin style
of Haydn and Mozart. There are many
passages in Clementi's early sonatas which
are similar in construction to passages afterward
written by Beethoven. Again, Clementi
extended and elaborated the "working out"
part, and sometimes introduced into the body
of a movement phrases from its introduction.
But the works of Beethoven speedily superseded
those of Clementi, and it is to these
we must now turn our attention. Fortunately
they call for only brief discussion, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Beethoven's sonatas are more remarkable for
their content than for their form.</p>

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born at Bonn,
Dec. 16, 1770. He studied music in his
native city and in Vienna, receiving a few
lessons and much encouragement there from
Mozart. He was for a time in the service
of the Elector of Cologne, but in 1792 he
went to Vienna to study under Haydn, and
there he finished his life, dying March 26,
1827. In Beethoven's youth the technics
of sonata composition had reached the point
of complete beauty, and the young man soon
set about making the sonata the vehicle of
personal expression. In doing so he introduced
some improvements into the form.
First of all he leaped to a greater freedom
in the use of keys. He not only wandered
into more remote keys than his predecessors
within the limits of a movement, but he made
wider changes of key in passing from one
movement to another. He elaborated the
slow introduction which preceded many of
his first movements (by no means all) and
made it of high significance. He constructed
the passage work leading from the first theme
to the second out of material taken from the
first theme, thus making a logical connection.
He sometimes introduced in the "working out"
part new thoughts, derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the original matter. He made intentional
and highly expressive use of the practice
of running one movement into another without
a pause, a device which had been employed
by Emmanuel Bach for purely musical
effect. Beethoven used it for purposes of
emotional expression. The complete <a name="first_movement_form" id="first_movement_form" />first movement
form, as developed by Beethoven,
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 center small smcap">First Part.</p>
<p class="small">Slow introduction (not always used): first theme, in the
tonic: connecting passage: second theme, in a related key:
concluding passage. [Repeat first part.]</p>

<p class="center small smcap">Middle Part.</p>
<p class="small">"Working out"&mdash;a free fantasia on both themes, developing
all their musical possibilities and dramatic expression
by devices of instrumental color, harmony, counterpoint,
etc.</p>

<p class="center small smcap">Third Part: Recapitulation.</p>
<p class="p2 small">First theme, in the tonic: connecting passage: second
theme, in the tonic: coda.</p>

<p>In place of the old minuet movement Beethoven
introduced the scherzo.</p>

<p>Scherzo means joke, and the scherzo was
originally a light, genial composition not to
be taken seriously. Haydn in writing his
minuets took the stateliness out of their
movement and imbued them with humor.
Beethoven, preserving the form and rhythm
of the minuet, so changed its tempo and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
melodic style that it became a new kind of
writing, which he called scherzo. But from
a merely jocular movement this grew in his
hands to be one of grim humor, and even,
as in the C minor symphony, of mystery and
awe.</p>

<p>The slow movement usually follows the
first movement. If there are four movements,
the scherzo is generally third, and the
finale, instead of being merely bright and
lively, is raised to an emotional importance
nearly as great as that of the first movement,
which it frequently follows in form. Beethoven's
music has been divided into three
styles, that of his earliest works showing distinctly
the influence of Haydn and Mozart.
Then comes a transition, to which the "Kreuzer"
sonata and the "Eroica" symphony belong,
and after that comes the second period,
containing the works of the master's maturity,
such as the piano sonata in D minor, the
"Appassionata," and the fifth and seventh
symphonies. The third style embodies the
sorrow and bitterness of Beethoven's unhappy
last years, and includes the ninth symphony
and the last five piano sonatas.</p>

<p>In the presence of Beethoven's music I
always feel the helplessness of analysis or
critical study. It is useless to try to reveal
the why and wherefore, but it cannot be denied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
that Beethoven's sonatas convey to the
hearer not only the presence of an imposing
personality, but the conviction that the expression
of the music is not simply individual,
but general. There is a breadth and a depth
to the utterance of these works which belong
not to one man but to humanity. Beethoven
succeeded in introducing into instrumental
music that direct, sweeping, overwhelming
proclamation of emotion which had previously
been regarded as the exclusive property of
the singer's voice. Beethoven's music is
essentially the dramatization of pure tones.
His intense expression was not the result of
accident. He hungered for it and studied
the means of imparting it to his music. In
doing so he solidified the structure of the
sonata in such a way that he made it the
most symmetrical, highly organized, and yet
elastic of all musical forms, and paved the
way for the whole school of romantic composers
who followed him, and who tried not
only to make music express the great elementary
emotions, as he did, but also to
make it tell complete stories. Their purposes
are best exemplified in their orchestral
works, and I must defer discussion of them
till after the reader has accompanied me in
a review of the development of the orchestra
and orchestral music.</p>

<h3>Evolution of the Orchestra</h3>

the string quartet&mdash;Handel and the foundation of the
modern style&mdash;The symphonic orchestra of Beethoven&mdash;Berlioz,

<p class="cap">THE modern orchestra is about two
hundred years old. That is to say,
the first skeleton of our present arrangement
of instruments is found near the close of the
seventeenth century. Earlier than that the
distribution of instruments and the manner
of writing for them contained none of the
essential elements of the present style.
Three centuries ago lutes and viols were
employed in combination with drums and
trumpets in a very confused manner, and
even for this assembly of instruments there
were no special compositions. An orchestra
as such can hardly be said to have made its
appearance until the time when the development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of music as a part of dramatic entertainments
compelled the preparation of some
sort of substantial accompaniment to the
choruses and dances. In the "Ballet
Comique de la Royne" (1581) of Beaujoyeux
there was an array of oboes, flutes,
cornets, trombones, violas di gamba (precursor
of the violoncello), lutes, harps,
flageolet, and ten violins. This looks like a
tolerable orchestra, but the manner of writing
for it prevented it from being one. The
performers were separated into ten bands,
each designed to accompany some particular
character or set of characters. Neptune and
his followers, for example, used harps and
flutes. The ten violins were employed only
in one scene. In those days, as we have
already seen, compositions were written "da
cantare e sonare," and a canzone for strings
was simply a piece of vocal polyphony
played instead of sung.</p>

<p>The advent of Italian opera and oratorio
ushered in the first organized use of the
orchestra. Cavaliere's "Anima e Corpo,"
an oratorio, had an orchestra consisting of a
viola di gamba, a harpsichord, a bass lute,
and two flutes. This orchestra, like that of
the Bayreuth theatre, was concealed. But
it was not used like a modern orchestra.
For instance, the composer recommended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
that a violin be employed to accompany the
soprano voice throughout the work. This
oratorio was produced in February, 1600,
and in December of the same year at the
first performance of Peri's opera, "Eurydice,"
the orchestra consisted of a harpsichord,
a viola di gamba, a large guitar, a
theorbo (large lute), and three flutes. These
last instruments were used only to imitate
the sounds of a Pandæan pipe, played by a
shepherd in the opera.</p>

<p>A decided advance in the development of
the orchestra was made by Claudio Monteverde,
whose "Orfeo" (1608) had an accompaniment
of two harpsichords, two bass viols,
ten tenor viols, two "little French violins,"
one harp, two large guitars, two organs
(small ones), two violas di gamba, four trombones,
one regal (a little reed organ), two
cornets, one piccolo, one clarion (an instrument
of the trumpet family), and three trumpets.
But even in this opera Monteverde
showed that he had not discovered the true
relations of the instruments. The "little
French violins" seem to be the first modern
violins used in the orchestra, yet they may
have been somewhat crude instruments, for
the first maker of real violins of whom we
know anything was Gasparo di Salo (1542-1610).
He was a much better maker of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
violas than of violins, and it was Giovanni
Paolo Maggini (1581-1631) who left us the
violin as we have it today. Monteverde
may have regarded violins from Salo's Lombardy
home, Brescia, as French, because
the French and Italians were continually
at war there. The violin, having once
entered the orchestra, however, speedily began
to move toward its proper position as
the principal voice, and as soon as composers
recognized its sphere, they began to
employ the other instruments with due regard
for their relative capacities. Monteverde
was the first composer who took advantage
of the contrasting qualities of tone
in the orchestra. His position in regard to
the treatment of orchestral music shows a
remarkable advance, and had a direct and
wide influence upon the development of the
orchestra.</p>

<p>Monteverde's operas contain many bits of
independent orchestral music, but it was in
attempting to illustrate the incidents of his
dramas by means of the orchestral part that
he divorced the accompaniment from the
voice parts and discovered the relative values
of some of his instruments. In one of his
operas he uses a string quartet, composed of
three violas and a bass, and while the voices
sing the text to a recitative, these instruments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
depict the rushing together of horses
in combat, the struggle of the opponents,
and other actions not described by the
text, but performed by the actors. In writing
this passage Monteverde invented two
well-known effects: the tremolo (a rapid
tremulous repetition of a single note), and
the pizzicato (plucking the strings with the
fingers). The feeling for instrumental description
displayed in this score led Monteverde
to emphasize the essential utility of
the strings, and at the same time it led him
to use the other instruments to produce
contrasts.</p>

<p>In the opera "Giasone" (1649) of Cavalli
we find a song accompanied by two violins
and a bass in a style which lasted till Handel's
day. Alessandro Stradella in 1676 used a
double orchestra in which violins were the
principal instruments. About the same time
we find Alessandro Scarlatti writing for first
and second violins, violas, and basses, distributing
the parts in quartet form, in the
same way as composers do today. He used
his first violin as the soprano of his string
quartet, his second violin as the alto, his
viola as the tenor, and his bass as the fundamental
bass. Wind instruments continued
to be used to add color and contrast to the
foundation of strings and in tutti passages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
(passages enlisting all the instruments of an
orchestra at once) to strengthen them.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to stop to consider
the orchestra employed by Sebastian Bach,
because his system of writing for orchestra
was not in the direct line of development,
though modern composers have learned
much from it. In his string writing he is
an excellent master for the present, but his
wood wind parts (flute, oboe, or bassoon) are
written usually in such a way that they
become separate solo voices. In short, his
instrumental scores lean toward the polyphonic,
rather than the monophonic style.
Handel (1685-1759) employed an orchestra
much like that of today, and methods not
unlike those of the present in writing for
it. In fact Handel's orchestra may be regarded
as the foundation of the modern symphonic
band. In his big oratorio choruses
Handel used a number of oboes to strengthen
the violin parts, and a number of bassoons
to strengthen the basses, but in other parts
of the same works he used the wind instruments
to enrich the general score with independent
parts. Again, he employed the wind
and strings separately, contrasting one with
the other just as modern composers do.</p>

<p>In the Hallelujah Chorus of Handel's
"Messiah" the orchestra consists of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
trumpets, kettle-drums, violins, violas, and
basses. In the chorus, "How Excellent," in
"Saul," the composer uses three trombones,
two trumpets, kettle-drums, three oboes, violins,
violas, and basses. For the purpose of
comparison, it may be stated that in his mass
in B minor Sebastian Bach used three trumpets,
tympani (kettle-drums), two flutes, two
oboes, two bassoons, violins, violas, basses,
and organ. The use of the wooden wind
instruments in pairs is noteworthy because
subsequent composers followed that practice.
Haydn's earlier works are written for two
horns, two oboes, two flutes, and the usual
array of strings. In his later works Haydn
employs nearly the full modern orchestra.
In "The Creation" he uses two trumpets,
tympani, three trombones, two clarinets, two
horns, two oboes, two flutes, two bassoons,
a contra-bassoon, violins, violas, and basses.
Haydn introduced the violoncello into the
orchestra, thus completing the modern list
of bowed string instruments; and Mozart
demonstrated the value of the clarinet, thus
completing the wood wind.</p>

<p>Beethoven's full orchestra consisted of two
flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons,
four horns, two trumpets, three trombones,
tympani, and the usual array of strings. These
instruments stand in this order in Beethoven's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
scores, reading from the top of the page
downward, and subsequent composers have
followed this arrangement. When voices appear
in the score, they are placed between the
violin and violoncello parts. Contemporaneous
composers incline to abandon that
custom, and to place the voices just above
the first violin part. This will keep the string
parts, the foundation of the accompaniment,
together below the voices, thus making the
score easier for the conductor to read. Beethoven's
orchestra was substantially that of
Schubert, Spohr, Mendelssohn, Weber, and
Schumann.</p>

<p>Later composers began to use various
characteristic instruments in their scores in
order to obtain special effects of what is called
instrumental color. Hector Berlioz (1803-1869)
did very much to advance this line of
development, and Richard Wagner (1813-1883)
carried on the work. Not only are
special instruments, such as the English horn
(a wooden wind instrument with a pastoral
tone, heard, for instance, as the shepherd's
pipe in "Tannhäuser" and "Tristan and
Isolde"), introduced, but the general mass
of instruments is enlarged or diminished
according to the composer's design. For
instance, in the first scene of Act III., "Die
Walküre," in which is the famous "Ride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of the Valkyrs," Wagner uses two piccolos
(small, high-pitched flutes, with a fife-like
tone), two flutes, three oboes, one English
horn, three clarinets, one bass clarinet, eight
French horns, three bassoons, four trumpets,
one bass trumpet, four trombones, one contrabass
tuba (a very deep-toned brass instrument),
four tympani, cymbals, snare-drums,
two harps, and the usual body of strings.
Wagner specifies thirty-two violins (sixteen
first and sixteen second) as necessary to produce
the proper balance of tone. Older
composers were content to take their chances
in such matters. In "Götterdämmerung"
the funeral march is scored for three clarinets,
one bass clarinet, four horns, three
bassoons, two tenor tubas, two bass tubas,
one contrabass tuba, one bass trumpet, four
trombones, tympani, and strings. The absence
of flutes, oboes and trumpets shows
that Wagner was aiming at a gloomy color,
to be obtained only by the omission of such
instruments and the use of an increased
number of those of low pitch.</p>

<p>The orchestra of today consists of four
groups of instruments, which can be enlarged
or curtailed according to the design of the
composer. These are, in the order in which
they usually stand in the score, wind instruments
of wood (the "wood wind"), wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
instruments of brass (called simply "the
brass"), instruments of percussion (drums,
cymbals, etc.), and strings. The general
plan of the orchestra, which has developed
from the earliest attempts at instrumental
contrast, contemplates such a distribution of
instruments in each department as to make
that department capable either of independent
employment, or of combination
with the whole or part of some other department,
or of incorporation in the mass of tone
produced by the whole orchestra. The
wood wind, for example, consists of flutes
and oboes, which are purely soprano instruments,
clarinets, which extended from upper
bass to moderately high soprano, English
horn, which has a tenor range, bass clarinet,
which runs from deep bass up into treble,
and bassoons, which comprise bass, baritone,
and tenor registers. That organization of
instruments is capable of independent performance,
possessing, as it does, all the components
of full and extended harmony and
a wide variety of color.</p>

<p>The brass choir consists of trumpets,
which are soprano instruments, French
horns (bass to alto), trombones (bass, baritone,
and tenor), and tubas (bass). This
band is capable of independent performance,
or of being joined in a body with the wood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
as in military music, or of combining with
the strings on the plan seen in its infancy in
Handel's "Hallelujah" chorus. The strings,
of course, contain all the elements necessary
to independence or combination. The
modern orchestra, however, has gained enormously
in power from the development of
methods of using parts of the separate choirs
independently or in combination. For instance,
flutes, clarinets, and bass clarinet can
produce rich four-part harmony, and so can
play alone. Flutes, oboes, and bassoons
can do the same thing and produce a wholly
different instrumental color. Bassoons and
French horns make fine deep-toned harmonies;
and four French horns can play alone
in full harmony. Any of these little groups
can be joined with strings to get a new
quality of tone. Thus it is not difficult to
see that the modern orchestra offers to the
composer a great variety of instrumental
combinations, giving him a remarkable
range of coloring, and it is equally plain
that these conditions have been gradually
developed by successive composers since the
days of Monteverde.</p>

classical symphony&mdash;Haydn and his achievements&mdash;Exploring

<p class="cap">THE classic orchestral composers are
those who wrote the classic piano
sonatas, and they developed their orchestral
works on the same lines as those of their
piano works. The symphony, as I have
already said, is nothing more nor less than
a sonata for orchestra; but it has its special
characteristics, and these deserve some attention.
The word "symphony" was first
applied to separate instrumental portions of
operas. For instance, an extended introduction
to an aria was called "sinfonia."
As ballet movements were introduced into
operas, and instrumental preludes came to
be employed, these separate pieces were more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and more extended, and the term "sinfonia"
came to be of considerable significance. The
early composers were compelled to seek for
some coherent design for their symphonies
and as that played before the opera was the
most independent of all, it was that in which
a definite form first made its appearance. It
was at first called "Sinfonia avanti l'Opera"&mdash;"symphony
before the opera." As such
it was written by Alessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725),
and the French composer, Giovanni
Battista Lulli (1633-1687). Lulli's overtures,
as they came to be called, were divided
into three movements, slow, lively, and slow,
without pauses between them. A diametrically
opposite form to this came to be known
as the "Italian Overture." Its movements
were lively, slow, lively&mdash;like those of the
three-movement sonata&mdash;except that there
was no pause between movements. The
origin of this form is the same as that of the
alternating movements of the sonata. It
took firm hold as soon as it appeared, and
from the beginning of the eighteenth century
was the acknowledged form.</p>

<p>The symphony now moved forward on
much the same lines as those of the piano
sonata, and what has been said about the
early steps in the development of that form
will apply to this one. It should be noted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
however, that the introduction of playing
opera overtures at concerts greatly aided the
development of the symphony. The introduction
of this custom was due to the time-honored
habit of going late to the opera.
The bustle of arrivals prevented the overtures
from being heard, and so it became the
custom to play them separately. The early
instrumental concertos had very great influence
on the development of the symphony,
because they showed composers the essential
differences between piano and orchestral
composition. These were not like our
modern concertos, written to display the
resources of some solo instrument, but were
literally concerts of instruments. In the
earliest forms contrasts of tone and power
were obtained by using a single trio or
quartet of strings for the principal passages,
and bringing in additional strings (called
"ripieno" instruments) to enforce the tone
in the tuttis. Alessandro Scarlatti wrote
concertos of this sort. Sebastian Bach wrote
a number of concertos for instruments, and
all of them are in the three-movement form
based on the Italian overture. Handel also
wrote concertos. But these concertos of
Handel and Bach were in the contrapuntal
style, and the genius of the sonata form was
tending always toward the monophonic style.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
For that reason these concertos did not have
so direct an influence on the symphony as
did the overture, which naturally followed
the vocal style of the opera.</p>

<p>The symphony in the early stages of the
classical period, which began with Emmanuel
Bach, followed pretty closely the lines of the
piano sonata in form. E. Bach was at work
writing symphonies when Haydn was a little
boy. It must be confessed, however, that
his symphonies are less distinct in form than
his piano sonatas. It is because of the decided
clearness of the orchestral works of
Haydn that he is celebrated as the father of
the symphony. He established the sonata
form and it is not at all surprising that he
applied it successfully to his orchestral compositions.
Haydn wrote (or is said to have
written) one hundred and eighteen symphonies,
beginning in 1759 and continuing
to his later years. His earliest works are so
irregular and uncertain that they do not
throw much light on anything except his
instrumentation. His position as conductor
of Prince Esterhazy's orchestra gave him
abundant opportunity to experiment with
instrumental forms and effects, and his symphonies
written during his long service in the
Esterhazy household show steady advance in
style. The Esterhazy orchestra contained in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
1766, six violins and violas, one 'cello, one
double bass, one flute, two oboes, two bassoons,
and four horns. It was afterward enlarged
to twenty-two, including trumpets and
kettle-drums. In 1776, after Haydn had
learned from Mozart how to use clarinets,
two of these instruments were added, making
twenty-four in all. It was a pretty small
orchestra according to our present ideas, but
it sufficed for the establishment of the
symphony.</p>

<p>Haydn improved not only in his method
of developing the subjects of his movements,
but in his knowledge of the kinds of themes
best fitted for orchestral treatment, which are
organically different from those suited to the
piano. His experiments in instrumentation
went far towards assisting composers to a
true knowledge of the art of orchestration
(writing for orchestra). He himself learned
rapidly from the trials of his own combinations
by the Esterhazy band. In his early
days, for instance, he frequently wrote the
same part for his first and second violins and
the same part for his violas and basses, so
that his strings were playing in only two
real parts, and his harmony was very thin.
His treatment of the wood wind was crude
at first, but his experiments rapidly improved
this, and by 1770 he had introduced the now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
familiar style of making the wind instruments
intone long chords, while the strings played
figured passages, or <i>vice versa</i>. The movements
of all his symphonies are very short,
and one who looks for great breadth or
depth in them will be disappointed. They
are bright and genial, except in their slow
movements, which are generally tender without
being pathetic. In the first movements
the working out is usually short, and not at
all involved, as if Haydn were timid about
presenting too much for intellectual consideration
at one time. The finale is generally in
rondo form, so that there is only one real
working out in the whole symphony.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the public
taste of that time would hardly have been
prepared for such advanced works as those
of Beethoven, even if Haydn's technic of
composition had been equal to the task of writing
them. The composer was thoroughly in
accord with the spirit of his time, and his
influence in popularizing good music cannot
be over-estimated. Haydn's later works
show a marked advance over his earlier ones,
which must be attributed to the influence of
Mozart. The reader will remember that
Mozart's life began after and ended before
Haydn's. Mozart also had opportunities
to learn something about the possibilities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
orchestral music while he was at Mannheim
in 1777. The band there was one of the
finest in Europe at the time, and its excellent
achievements in light and shade no doubt gave
Mozart many valuable suggestions. Mozart
wrote forty-nine symphonies, but only
three of them are heard often today: that in
E-flat major, op. 543, that in G minor, op.
550, and that in C major, op. 551, commonly
called the "Jupiter" symphony. These were
his last three symphonies, written in 1788,
and it is notable that in none of the three is
the full Beethoven orchestra employed. All
three use only one flute. The E-flat symphony
has clarinets, but no oboes. The
other two have oboes, but no clarinets. The
G minor has no drums nor trumpets, and
none has trombones. Nevertheless, by the
pure beauty of their melodic subjects, the
clearness of their discussion, and their general
grace and symmetry, these works have succeeded
in maintaining a place among living
music. They are most satisfactory examples
of the kind of composition produced in the
classic period, the period of pure beauty in
music. It is difficult to discuss the work of
Mozart with judicial calm, even at this distance
from the time of its performance.
Contemporaneous records all bear such enthusiastic
testimony as to the extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
genius of the wonderful boy that it is difficult
to avoid injustice to his works. We must
remember that in Mozart's boyhood, when
he wrote his first symphonies, the form of
the sonata was still uncertain, and we must,
therefore, be satisfied with finding in his
precocious compositions a keen perception
of the value of balance and continuity.</p>

<p>It was after writing his first three symphonies
that Mozart began to hear operas,
and this greatly improved his style. His
Parisian symphony, opus 297, produced in
1778, shows the results of his operatic study
as well as his attention to the Mannheim
band. The first movement is decidedly
irregular in form, abounding in different
melodies and striking harmonies. The subjects
are dramatic in feeling, but in construction
are essentially orchestral. In his last
three symphonies he shows a complete mastery
of the organization of the orchestral
sonata in its then stage of development,
which was chiefly his work. A peculiarity
of Mozart's style was its generous employment
of free counterpoint,&mdash;that is, polyphonic
writing in which the different voices
occasionally intone different melodies (or
parts of them) at the same time, without
adherence to canonic law. This kind of
counterpoint is common in modern orchestral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
composition. Otto Jahn, the authoritative
biographer of Mozart, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The perfection of the art of counterpoint
is not the distinguishing characteristic
of this symphony [C major] alone, but of
them all [the last three]. The enthralling
interest of the development of each movement
in its necessary connection and continuity
consists chiefly in the free and liberal
use of the manifold resources of counterpoint.
The ease and certainty of this mode
of expression make it seem fittest for what
the composer has to say. Freedom of treatment
penetrates every component part of
the whole, producing an independent, natural
motion of each. The then novel art of
employing the wind instruments in separate
and combined effects was especially admired
by Mozart's contemporaries. His treatment
of the stringed instruments showed a progress
not less advanced, as, for instance, in
the free treatment of the basses, as characteristic
as it was melodious. The highest
quality of the symphonies, however, is their
harmony of tone-color, the healthy combination
of orchestral sound, which is not to
be replaced by any separate effects, however
charming. In this combination consists the
art of making the orchestra as a living organism
express the artistic idea which gives the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
creative impulse to the work, and controls
the forces which are always ready to be set
in motion. An unerring conception of the
capacities for the development contained in
each subject, of the relations of contrasting
and conflicting elements, of the proportions
of the parts composing the different movements,
and of the proportions of the movements
to the whole work; finally, of the
proper division and blending of the tone-colors,&mdash;such
are the essential conditions for
the production of a work of art which is to
be effective in all its parts. Few persons will
wish to dispute the fact that Mozart's great
symphonies display the happiest union of invention
and knowledge, of feeling and taste."</p>

<p>Haydn's later works gained much from
their composer's study of the clear form, the
pure orchestral idiom, and the musical beauty
of Mozart's. Furthermore the orchestral descriptions
of chaos, the birth of light, spring,
summer, etc., in "The Creation" and "The
Seasons" were made possible to Haydn by
Mozart's experiments in instrumental tone-coloring.
But this is aside from the present
subject. It will be well for the reader now
to grasp a few defined facts as to the state of
the symphony when Beethoven took it up.
Here I must again appeal to a master of
the subject, Dr. Parry, who says:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the end of their time [Haydn's and
Mozart's] instrumental art had branched
out into a very large number of distinct and
complete forms, such as symphonies, concertos,
quartets, trios, and sonatas for violin
and clavier. The style appropriate to each
had been more or less ascertained, and the
schemes of design had been perfectly organized
for all self-dependent instrumental
music. Both Haydn and Mozart had immensely
improved in the power of finding
characteristic subjects, and in deciding the
type of subject which is best fitted for instrumental
music. The difference in that respect
between their early and later works is very
marked. They improved the range of the
symphonic cycle of movements by adding
the minuet and trio to the old group of
three movements, thereby introducing definite
and undisguised dance movements to
follow and contrast with the central cantabile
slow movement. Between them they had
completely transformed the treatment of the
orchestra. They not only enlarged it and
gave it greater capacity of tone and variety,
but they also laid the solid foundations of
those methods of art which have become
the most characteristic and powerful features
in the system of modern music. Even in
detail the character of music is altered; all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
phraseology is made articulate and definite;
and the minutiæ which lend themselves to
refined and artistic performance are carefully
considered, without in any way diminishing
the breadth and freedom of the general
effect. There is hardly any branch or department
of art which does not seem to have
been brought to high technical perfection by
them; and if <i>the world could be satisfied
with the ideal of perfectly organized simplicity
without any great force of expression</i>, instrumental
art might well have stopped at the
point to which they brought it."</p>

<p>Dr. Parry has, in the passage which I
have italicized, touched the marrow of the
matter. Haydn's and Mozart's symphonies,
however they may have impressed their contemporaries,
appeal to us through their perfect
transparency, their balance of form, their
fluency of instrumental language, and their
simple beauty of style. The working out
parts of their symphonies, for instance, are
devoted wholly to the exposition of the
musical fruitfulness of their subjects. There
is nowhere any evidence of an attempt to
employ the apparatus of the symphony for
a systematic communication of emotion.
These works do, indeed, at times arouse
our feelings, but there is no conviction that
their composers designed them to speak a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
message of the inner life to us. They are
the perfect embodiments of pure musical
beauty, and it was not till Beethoven took up
the form which they had perfected that it
became the definite embodiment of feeling,
the systematic means of expression.</p>

<p>What has already been said about Beethoven's
piano sonatas applies with equal
propriety to his symphonies. But something
may be added, because the symphonies
exhibit Beethoven's characteristics in their
most imposing garb, and it is through them
that he comes into his most influential relations
with the great mass of music lovers.
But as Beethoven's symphonies mark a
transition from the classic to the romantic
era, it will be more logical to consider them
in a chapter including the romantic writers.</p>

<p class="cap">THE classical period in musical history
is that in which composers appear to
have been engaged in perfecting the form
and technic of composition. The impulse
which led them to make their improvements
was the romantic impulse, for by romanticism
in music we mean an impulse which urges
the composer toward expression. Such an
impulse has always been at work in music,
but it was impossible for the classical composers
to give it free exercise, because they
had not fully established a method of composition.
Beethoven found the method
pretty well formulated. His material was
ready to his hand. In the sonata form his
predecessors had prepared for him a vehicle
which they had fully proved to be capable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a clear, logical, and luminous presentation
and development of beautiful musical ideas.
It remained for Beethoven to prove that the
symphony, the orchestral sonata, was not
only the most complex, diversified, and yet
organically unified of all musical forms, but
that most thoroughly suited to the embodiment
of great mood-pictures, outpourings of
love, suffering, despair, joy, triumph. It
remained for Beethoven to show how the
four movements of a symphony, without
any merely technical links, could be made to
picture a succession of emotional states which
should have a natural variety and an equally
natural homogeneity.</p>

<p>Because Beethoven's symphonies stand today
as the highest types of absolute music,
and because all of them are living music,
heard in concert rooms, I quote the list with
dates of production, etc., from Sir George
Grove's admirable work: "Beethoven and
his Nine Symphonies."</p>

In the chapter on the sonata I have already
mentioned some of the details of Beethoven's
developments. As displayed in his symphonies
the technical changes which call for
especial mention are first strikingly seen in
the "Eroica." Here we find that Beethoven
made the progress from his first to his second
subject (see outline of <a href="#first_movement_form">first movement form</a>,
Chap. X.) in a thoroughly logical and organic
manner. In the working out he introduced
new melodic episodes, but he never forgot
that they were subordinate to the two melodic
topics of his movement. In the third
part of the first movement he introduced a
coda of 140 measures, in which new subject
matter is introduced, and part of it made to
act as a "descant" above the first principal
theme.</p>

As Sir George Grove has said, "this
coda is no mere termination to a movement
which might have ended as well without it.
No, it is an essential part of the poem, and will
be known as such. It is one of Beethoven's
great inventions, and he knows it, and starts
it in such a style that no one can possibly
overlook what he is doing." In the same
symphony Beethoven entitles his slow movement
"March," and his third movement
"Scherzo." Both of these titles were new
to the symphony. The finale is made more
important and more expressive than it has
ever been in any previous work. In his
sixth symphony Beethoven gave each of the
movements descriptive titles, such as "Scene
by the brook." This was a distinct innovation
in symphonic writing, and the artistic
beauty and eloquence of the work prove that
the symphony as a form was capable of the
most free expressiveness. In the fifth symphony
the composer demonstrated in the
convincing manner the complete organization
of the form by using a single motive, that
which introduces the work, as the germ and
the connecting instrument of the whole. The
fifth symphony is the most convincing of all
Beethoven's works. Its portrayal of man's
struggle against fate and his final triumph is
superb; yet in form the symphony is absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
perfect. In his seventh symphony he
developed the slow introduction to the first
movement, which has previously occupied a
dozen measures, to sixty-two. In his ninth
symphony he made his only confession of the
inadequacy of his instrumental means. He
introduced voices. The ninth symphony is
a work of transcendent genius, and its effect
justifies its method; but the use of voices in
instrumental works since has almost inevitably
failed. Only Beethoven could bridge
the chasm between musical mood-pictures
without words and music leaning on the
shoulder of text.</p>

<p>Beethoven's symphonies are the connecting
link between the classic and romantic
schools. They are classic because they adhere
to the classic form; they are romantic
because they are the instruments of direct,
intentional, and highly designed expression.
Beethoven was satisfied to accomplish the full
achievement of expression within the limits
of the classic form. His successors, despairing
of succeeding on the same lines, and
urged by a desire for personal and representative
expression as strong as his, broke
away from the classic form of the sonata, but
to this day have never been able to escape
the sovereignty of its fundamental principles.
The kinds of musical devices which Beethoven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
employed in making his designs expressive,
in the widest and deepest sense of
that word, may not be discussed here. To
attempt to discuss them would lead the
reader into the field of pure musical technics.
The great fact for him to keep in mind is
this: Beethoven seized upon the musical
material left him by his predecessors, and instead
of employing it to produce simple
beauty, used it to express his inner life,
treating that life as typical and hence as
capable of representation in the broad tints
of orchestral music. His successors in the
composition of symphonic music have followed
his lead, some adhering to the classical
form and others departing from it, according
to the bent of their genius. All of them,
however, have sought to employ the power
of music to express emotion, some following
plans with broad outlines and others endeavoring
to enter into detail. Because these
composers have proclaimed the expressive
power of music, they are classed as romanticists.
It should be noted, however, that
many historians include in the classic school
all those who adhere strictly to the classic
form.</p>

<p>A product of the romantic school is called
"programme music." This means music
which is intended to illustrate a definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
story, and its best examples are those which
endeavor to illustrate wholly by voicing in
music the sequence of emotions contained in
the tale, with the aid of such descriptive
music as will convey some idea of the scenic
surroundings. The reader will readily understand
that some acquaintance with the
composer's purpose is necessary to an appreciation
of such music. A key to the plan is
offered usually by the title. A composition
labelled "Macbeth" would, of course, be
understood as intended to illustrate Shakespeare's
tragedy, and the hearer would naturally
call to his aid in listening to it his
knowledge of the drama. Two familiar
forms of programme music have grown out
of the attempts of the romanticists. One of
these is the symphonic poem, and the other
the programme overture. The symphonic
poem is a composition symphonic in style
and general treatment, but shorter than a
symphony and without pauses between its
movements and designed to illustrate a story.
An attentive listener will find that a symphonic
poem contains definite principal
themes, development or working out, climaxes,
and conclusion, for no matter what
the sequence of emotions in the story may
be, the fundamental laws of musical form
must be observed. The programme overture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
is an overture built on lines much the
same as those of a symphonic poem, but
designed as a musical prelude to a play, or
a poem of dramatic contents, as, for example
Tschaikowsky's "Hamlet" overture, or
Goldmark's "Sakuntala" overture. The
latter belongs to a poem.</p>

<p>In addition to these forms the romanticists
have made certain alterations in the
old sonata form. One of Schumann's symphonies,
that in D minor, is in the usual
four movements, but without any pauses
between them, and the principal subjects of
the work are heard in various forms in the
various movements. This plan was followed
by Liszt in his piano concertos, which
are played without pauses and have their
several movements largely developed from
the themes announced at the beginning of
the works.</p>

<p>The principal symphonic writers since
Beethoven have been Ludwig Spohr (1784-1859),
Franz Schubert (1797-1828), Felix
Mendelssohn-Bartoldy (1809-1847), Robert
Schumann (1810-1856), Hector Berlioz
(1803-1869), Franz Liszt (1811-1886),
Johannes Brahms (1833-1897), Peter
Ilitisch Tschaikowsky (1840-1893) and
Antonin Dvorak (1841,&mdash;still living).
Spohr's symphonies are generally classic in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
form, but romantic in subject and treatment,
as is indicated by their titles, "Lenore" (on
Burger's poem), "Power of Sound," "Consecration
of Tones." Schubert's symphonies
are also classic in form, and only mildly romantic
in content. Schubert was one of
the leaders of the romantic school, but his
romanticism found its most complete embodiment
in his songs. Mendelssohn's
symphonies are absolutely classic in form
and in the finish of their style and instrumentation,
but they are romantic in tendency.
His overtures&mdash;such as "Hebrides"
and "Melusine"&mdash;are unquestionably of
the romantic spirit. Schumann was an
ultra-romanticist and his piano music teems
with compositions with suggestive titles,
such as "Papillons" and "Carnival." His
symphonies are romantic in the fulness of
their plan to embody emotion. Hector
Berlioz, the famous French symphonist,
was one of the extreme romanticists. His
symphonies are really symphonic poems
in several detached movements and are all
original in form. Sometimes he uses voices
to help him out, but usually he is content
with the orchestra, which he handled with a
marvellous insight into its capacity. His
symphonies all bear suggestive titles,&mdash;as
"Romeo and Juliet" or "Harold in Italy,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and are designed to illustrate stories. Franz
Liszt was the inventor of the symphonic
poem, and is included in this catalogue
chiefly for that reason. His works are very
rich in color, and occasionally rise to a level
of real power.</p>

<p>Tschaikowsky was a Russian composer
and produced six symphonies, all of which
depart from the strict classic form, make
free use of Russian style in their melodies,
and are intensely romantic in spirit. His
fifth symphony introduces a slow waltz
instead of a scherzo. His sixth, the "Symphony
Pathetique," is one of the noblest of
modern symphonies. Its second movement
is a waltz in five-fourth measure (five beats
to the bar), its third a scherzo which turns
into a march, and its last is the slow movement.
In the first movement a partial
working out of each theme follows immediately
upon the first appearance of the
theme. Dvorak is a Bohemian, and most
of his works are Slavonic in color. He
has introduced as a slow movement the
"Dumka," or elegy, and in place of the
scherzo the "furiant," which is explained by
its name. During a stay in the United States
he conceived the idea that an American element
could be introduced into music by
using themes resembling those of negro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
songs and Indian chants. His chief exemplification
of his theory is found in his symphony
in E minor, "From the New World."
Dvorak's symphonies adhere closely to the
principles of the sonata form, and are very
popular in style without descending from the
level of artistic music.</p>

<p>The music of Johannes Brahms has given
rise to a great deal of controversy. Most
recent writers have shown a tendency to break
away from the strict letter of the sonata form,
and too many commentators have come to
mistake manner for matter. In calling those
writers classic who have adhered to the classic
sonata they have too often denied to them
the possession of romantic feeling. At the
same time some commentators have seemed
to think that it was a work of virtue to preserve
the sonata form precisely as it was left
to us by the hand of Beethoven, while others
held that any man who adhered to it was a
mere formalist. It was criticism of this kind
which obscured the merits of the late Johannes
Brahms in his early days. It was
not difficult for the commentators to perceive
that Brahms employed the sonata form, and
that he preserved the outlines laid down by
Beethoven. For that they praised him, as
if it were a <i>sine qua non</i> of absolute music that
it should be in the sonata form. It is generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
conceded that that form is the most
intellectual, the most highly organized, which
has yet been devised; but it is not and ought
not to be conceded that a man is bound to
adhere to that form. If he can produce
another which presents an equally convincing
process of musical development and conclusion,
he deserves laudation as one who is
not a mere student of forms, but is a master
of the philosophy of form.</p>

<p>A piece of music is not necessarily formless
because it is not built on the model of
one of the acknowledged forms. A composer
is not a heretic because he builds a new pattern.
But there are certain fundamentals of
form, and these we should demand in every
work. In the simplest music we should require
that there be recognizable a beginning,
a middle, and an end. We should demand
discernible rhythms and symmetrical phrases,
and we should require that these be exhibited
throughout the composition with evident design.
In the higher forms there ought to be
melodic subjects, and these subjects ought to
be discussed and developed. It is almost
impossible to escape the cyclic form, with its
proposition, discussion, and conclusion; but
if the composer does escape it, we must insist
upon it that he adhere to the essential principle
of repetition and that he distribute his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
repetitions in such a manner as to preserve
the symmetry and balance of his work and
to effect an organic unity. His work should
contain nothing that does not belong to it.
Every phrase should be, as W. A. Hadow
suggests, "inevitable."</p>

<p>On the other hand a man is not necessarily
a mere formalist because he clings to the old-fashioned
sonata form. Brahms's compositions
show a completeness of architectonic
detail, superimposed upon a symmetrical and
inevitable organic development, such as are
to be found in those of no other symphonist,
except Beethoven. Why deny to the late
Viennese master depth of feeling because he
fashioned the expression of that feeling with
all the force of a gigantic musical intellect?
Brahms's music grows slowly in popular favor
because it is not easy for the careless hearer
to grasp its inner spirit. But it is not true
that music, to be real music, demands a Swinburnian
diction.</p>

great poetry:&mdash;</p>

and his time Brahms was, and he will be
hailed, as Milton was, an organ voice of his
country. The irresistible seriousness of Germany
has never spoken with more convincing
accent than in the music of Brahms.
There is a feeling in this music which is far
removed from the possibility of a purely
sensuous embodiment. It may take time for
the entire musical world to come under the
spell of this austere utterance; but Brahms
had the happiness of knowing ere he died
that wherever music was cultivated his individuality
at least had made itself known.</p>

<h3>The Development of Chamber Music</h3>

<p class="cap">BY chamber music is meant all that class
of compositions written for small collections
of instruments and therefore suitable
for performance in small rooms only. It
embraces trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, septets,
and octets, named according to the number
of instruments employed. The trio is
most frequently written for piano, violin, and
'cello, but other combinations, such as piano,
violin, and horn, etc., are used. When the
word "quartet" is used alone, it signifies a
string quartet, consisting of first violin,
second violin, viola, and 'cello. A "piano
quartet" is one in which the second violin is
absent and a piano appears. A quintet for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
strings may be for two violins, two violas,
and 'cello (the usual arrangement), or two
violins, one viola, and two 'celli. A piano
quintet has a piano instead of the second
viola or second 'cello. Compositions for
more than five instruments seldom use the
piano, but frequently introduced wood or
brass instruments. But it is not possible to
fix any definite distribution of instruments in
chamber music, as there are compositions for
almost every conceivable combination, including
those of wind instruments only.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand that chamber
music originated in the early medieval
custom of accompanying banquets with
music. Small bodies of instrumental players
formed for this purpose soon created a demand
for a separate kind of music for their
performance, as well as a desire to hear such
music. Indeed chamber music, as such, existed
before orchestral music, for the old
sonatas in four-voiced counterpoint, written
<i>da cantare e sonare</i>, when performed as instrumental
compositions, constituted what we
should class today as chamber music. But
genuine modern chamber music began to
take form when the violin began to assert its
true position and the correct balance of strings
began to be perceived. This, as we have
seen, was subsequent to the time of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
violin maker Maggini (1581-1631) and previous
to that the violinist Corelli (1653-1713).
In his labors tending toward the
development of the sonata form Corelli
wrote real chamber music. His compositions
were classed either as "Sonate di
Chiesa" or "Sonate da Camera,"&mdash;church
sonatas or chamber sonatas. The sonatas
employed small combinations of instruments
in which the violin and the organ were the
chief principals, together with lutes and
other stringed instruments. Their relation
to the development of the sonata form has
already been pointed out. The distribution
of instruments, as leading toward modern
chamber music is what now concerns us.
Corelli's first publication in this line was
"XII Sonate a tre, due violini e violoncello,
col basso per l'organo," opus 1, Rome, 1683.
In 1685 (the year of Bach's birth) he published
twelve "sonate da camera" for two
violins, 'cello, and cembalo. He published
other collections, one of which contained
sonatas for four violins, violoncello, and bass,
two violins and the 'cello playing the principal
parts and the other instruments re-enforcing
them in the ensemble passages.
The successors of Corelli followed his lead
and produced many compositions for small
collections of instruments, though it must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
borne in mind that the idea of formal concerts
of chamber music, such as we have now,
did not exist then.</p>

<p>When the development of instrumental
music began to take a definite direction in
Germany, chamber music pure and simple
made its appearance, and Germany is the
home of this kind of composition. John
Adam Reinken (born at Deventer, Holland,
1623, died at Hamburg, 1722, an organist,
studied under Swelinck, of the last period of
the Netherlands school) wrote a composition
called "Hortus Musicus" for two violins,
viola, and bass, published at Hamburg, 1704.
This composition is what we should now
call a suite, and it shows that the art of writing
music for a quartet had made considerable
progress. We get some light as to the
sort of encouragement given to this kind of
music from the fact that instrumental performances
by small bodies were cultivated
earnestly at the ducal court of Weimar between
1708 and 1715, chiefly because the
duke's nephew, Johann Ernst, "showed
considerable talent for playing the violin and
clavier, and even for composition" [Spitta's
"Life of Bach"]. Frederick the Great played
the flute, and it is thought that this had some
influence with Sebastian Bach, who was much
admired by the king. At any rate Bach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
wrote a sonata for clavier, violin, and flute.
He also wrote a trio for two violins and bass,
and other works which belonged to the
chamber music class. Quartet writing had
made its way into France, where François
Joseph Gossec (1733-1829) published his
first quartet in 1759, the year in which
Haydn wrote his first symphony.</p>

<p>Chamber music known to the modern
concert room dates from the first quartet of
Haydn, written in 1755. In the earlier
works the form was uncertain, and it was
not until the sonata took definite shape that
composers discovered that the sonata form
was the best adapted to the development of
thematic ideas suitable for chamber music,
as well as that of those suitable for symphonies.
Scientific musicians were at first
prone to scoff at the string quartet as too
slight in texture to afford a vehicle for the
display of genius. That was because they
had not fully mastered the art of writing a
four-part harmony with occasional transitions
into the pure polyphonic style,&mdash;a method
of writing which is indispensable to quartet
composition,&mdash;and also because they did
not yet thoroughly understand the scope
and value of each individual instrument.
It cannot be said that even Haydn penetrated
the secrets of the capacities of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
four instruments, for his quartet writing
shows frequent baldness in this respect; but
he did write in four-part harmony, and his
quartets beyond all question set the pattern
for all that have followed them. Haydn
wrote seventy-seven quartets, and naturally
his latest show an advance in style and
treatment over his earliest. These quartets
are characterized by the fluency and simplicity
of their melodies, the conciseness and
symmetry of their form, the clearness and
balance of their part writing, and the sunny
sweetness of their prevailing mood. There
is nothing in the shape of instrumental
music much pleasanter or easier to listen to
than one of Haydn's quartets. The best of
them hold their places in the concert rooms
of today, and they seem likely to live as
long as there are people to appreciate clear
and logical composition which attempts nothing
beyond "organized simplicity."</p>

<p>Mozart wrote a great quantity of chamber
music, including string quintets, a quintet
for clarinet and strings, a quintet for horn
and strings, thirty quartets, a quintet for
piano, oboe, horn, clarinet, and bassoon, two
piano quartets and eight trios. His six
early quartets, dedicated to Haydn and published
in 1785, do not make any alterations
in the form fixed by Haydn. But, to quote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the words of Mozart's biographer, Otto
Jahn, "following a deeply rooted impulse
of his nature, he renounced the light and
fanciful style in which Haydn treated them
[the features of the form], seized upon their
legitimate points, and gave a firmer and
more delicate construction to the whole
fabric. To say of Mozart's quartets in
their general features that, in comparison
with Haydn's, they are of deeper and fuller
expression, more refined beauty, and broader
conception of form, is only to distinguish
these as Mozart's individual characteristics,
in contrast with Haydn's inexhaustible fund
of original and humorous productive power."
What is here said of Mozart's early quartets
applies fairly to all his chamber music. His
part writing is always delightful in its clearness
and in its preservation of the balance
of power among the instruments. Every
one has something agreeable to say, and the
saying of it never becomes a muddle of
sound. The composer's peculiar feeling
for vocal style, already mentioned, gives his
various parts a fluency of melody not to be
found in the works of some more pretentious
composers.</p>

<p>The complete establishment of the quartet
as an art-form worthy to rank beside the
symphony is due to Beethoven. The list
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of Beethoven's chamber music comprises
the following: two octets in E-flat for wind,
one septet for strings and wind, one sextet
in E-flat for strings and wood, one sextet in
E-flat for wind, two quintets for strings,
sixteen quartets for strings, two "Equali"
for four trombones, five trios for strings, one
trio for strings and flute, one trio for wind,
three duos for wind, one quintet for piano
and wind, one quartet for piano and strings,
eight trios for piano and strings, ten sonatas
for piano and violin, five sonatas for piano
and 'cello, and a few other works. The
trios are uncommonly fine compositions,
but the quartet was Beethoven's especial
choice among chamber music forms, and he
used it for the embodiment of some of his
noblest thoughts. All that has been said
about his treatment of the piano sonata and
the symphony applies to his treatment of
the quartet. Beethoven could not by any
possibility take up such a peculiarly intimate
form of music without infusing into
it a new life. He made it the vehicle for
the expression of a marvellous depth of
feeling. In doing so he made variations
in the established form, but without over-throwing
or ignoring any of its fundamental
principles. Sir George Grove says, "The
obscurity and individuality of the thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
themselves, and their apparent want of connection
until they have become familiar, is
perhaps the cause that these noble works
[the later quartets] are so difficult to understand."
But it is generally conceded by
critics and musicians that Beethoven's quartets,
particularly those in F, E minor, and
C, dedicated to Count Rassoumoffsky, and
called the "Rassoumoffsky Quartets," are
the noblest specimens of chamber music
extant. In his "Life of Mozart" Otto
Jahn says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The string quartet offers the most
favorable conditions for the development
of instrumental music, both as to expression
and technical construction, giving free play
to the composer in every direction, provided
only that he keep within the limits imposed
by the nature of his art. Each of the four
combined instruments is capable of the
greatest variety of melodic construction;
they have the advantage over the piano in
their power of sustaining the vibrations of
the notes, so as to produce song-like effects;
nor are they inferior in their power of rapid
movement. Their union enables them to
fulfil the demands of complete harmonies,
and to compensate increase of freedom and
fulness for the advantages which the pianoforte
possesses as a solo instrument."</p>

<p>The listener to Beethoven's quartets will
be impressed with the applicability of these
words to them, and he will in a measure be
prepared to see where some of Beethoven's
successors have failed. Schubert, Schumann,
Mendelssohn, Spohr, and other German
composers wrote admirable chamber
music. So have some of the French and
Italian composers. But it cannot be said that
this branch of instrumental art, its purest
and most thoroughly symmetrical form, has
made any advance since Beethoven's day.
On the contrary, it has retrograded. This
is from two causes: first, the frequency with
which piano parts are written in a style so
massive and brilliant as to overwhelm the
strings in trios or piano quartets and quintets;
and second, the unwise attempts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
some composers to imitate heavy orchestral
effects with only four or five stringed
instruments.</p>

<p>Among those who have produced the
best chamber music in recent years must be
mentioned Brahms and Dvorak, who have
been named in the chapter preceding this.
The chamber music of Brahms includes a
sextet for strings, three piano quartets, a
piano quintet, several trios, three string
quartets, a string quintet, and a quintet for
clarinet and strings. These works are conspicuous
for the completeness of their musical
organism, the originality, profundity, and
artistic reticence of their style, the deep
learning with which they treat modern
thoughts in a revised polyphony, and the
breadth of their intellectual earnestness. It
is difficult to understand how any one can
deny the genius of Brahms after hearing a
good performance of such music as the
slow movement and scherzo of his piano
quintet.</p>

<p>Dvorak has written a considerable quantity
of chamber music, but no final criticism
can yet be passed upon it. The composer
himself realizes that his earlier quartets
and trios, though melodious and clear, contained
a great deal of discursive matter. His
later writings show an immense improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
in conciseness, strength, and closeness
of development. His American quartet
and quintet are admirable as examples
of form and of treatment of instrumental
voices.</p>

<p class="cap">HAVING traced the development of
piano music, chamber music, and the
symphony, from the time at which these began
to be separate branches of art up to the
present, it now becomes necessary to return
to the point of departure and follow a new
line of progress. It is the task of the reader
now to accompany me in an examination into
the origin of oratorio. Difficult as it may
be to realize it now, the oratorio was in its
infancy a dramatic performance, and it took
its origin from the ancient religious drama,
which, indeed, is the source of all modern
drama. Greek plays, as imitated very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
badly by the Romans, most directly affected
oratorio. The Greek drama began at the
altar of Bacchus, where the priestesses sang
about the sacrificial goat, the goat song, the
"tragos ode," the tragedy. At Delphi grew
up representations of the slaying of a serpent
by Apollo, and at Eleusis the "Eleusinian
mysteries" portrayed in dramatic
action the rape of Persephone and the
wanderings of Demeter. So originated the
Greek drama, which until the death of
Æschylus was chiefly an embodiment of the
religious beliefs and hopes of the Greeks.</p>

<p>When Christianity was introduced in
Greece and Rome the people clung to the
play form and continued to use the old
mythological personages. The fathers of
the Church speedily perceived that such
plays were distinctly hostile to the progress
of the true faith, so they set about writing
religious dramas which should present to the
people the facts of Christianity quite as attractively
as the older plays presented those
of Paganism. This work began in the
second century (if not earlier), but the
old ideas clung firmly. A curious drama
called "Christ's Passion," long supposed to
have been written by St. Gregory Nazianzen,
Patriarch of Constantinople near the end of
the fourth century, contains a curious mixture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of Biblical personages, church hymns
and extracts from Greek plays. About one-third
of the verse, for instance, is taken from
Euripides. Dr. Brambs, of Leipsic, has
proved that this "Christ's Passion" dates
from the tenth, not the fourth century. It
is not difficult to see how the early Christian
dramas could have developed from the elaborate
liturgical presentations of such events
as the nativity, the annunciation, and the
crucifixion. Indeed there are extant some
twenty-seven or twenty-eight liturgical arrangements
which are purely dramatic in
form and style. Their musical part was
provided by the old Latin hymns. In one
of these dramas, "The Shepherds," occur
passages used in Handel's oratorios, such as
"Glory to God in the highest," and "Behold,
a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a
son."</p>

<p>It was a natural outcome of the social condition
of the era that in the course of time
these dramas, enacted frequently in the open
air, forced to appeal to a heterogeneous mass
of densely ignorant persons, and bound to
employ their very superstitions in order to
gain their comprehension, should have permitted
the introduction of all kinds of
triviality and vulgarity. In "The Fall of
Lucifer" the devil was introduced with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
horns, tail, cloven hoof, and a glaring red
beard. Noah's wife, in another play, refused
to go into the ark, and Noah took a stout
cudgel to her. Adam and Eve appeared
naked, and donned their fig leaves in the presence
of the audience. One very popular play
in the fifteenth century was performed on
a three-story stage, of which the top story
represented heaven, the middle one earth,
and the lowest one hell. The devil had
now become the buffoon of the drama, and
was driven about by the populace with blows
from inflated bladders tied to the ends of
sticks. In one play there were four devils to
keep the fun going, and jugglers, acrobats,
and buffoons were introduced, until the medieval
religious drama resembled the modern
"farce comedy."</p>

<p>A reform, which led to the establishment
of the oratorio, was caused by the work of
St. Philip Neri (born in Florence, 1515),
founder of the Congregation of the Fathers
of the Oratory at Rome. An old Italian
writer, Crescembini, says: "The Oratorio,
a poetical composition, formerly a commixture
of the dramatic and narrative styles, but
now entirely a musical drama, had its origin
from San Filippo Neri, who in his chapel,
after sermons and other devotions, in order
to allure young people to pious offices, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to detain them from earthly pleasure, had
hymns, psalms, and such like prayers sung
by one or more voices.... Among these
spiritual songs were dialogues." The truth
is that St. Philip Neri induced capable
Italian poets to make his librettos, which
consisted of dialogues interspersed with choruses.
The music he had written by the
best composers, even Palestrina contributing
to the good cause. The beauty and purity
of these works caused them to become popular
among the more intelligent young Romans,
and St. Philip's oratory (whence the
name oratorio) was always crowded.</p>

<p>The invention of dramatic recitative near
the close of the sixteenth century produced
a marked effect on oratorio. It very quickly
took the place of the dialogue, and thence-forward
for many years there was little difference
between opera and oratorio except in
the nature of their subjects. The first oratorio
with dramatic recitative, of which any
account has come down to us, was "L'Anima
e Corpo," written by Laura Guidiccioni and
composed by Emilio del Cavaliere, one of
the little band of musical explorers who gave
us opera. This oratorio was performed in
Rome in 1600. The orchestra, consisting of
a double lyre, a harpsichord, a large guitar,
and two flutes, was placed behind the scenes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and the oratorio was presented as a musical
drama. The chorus sat on the stage, but
when singing arose and made appropriate
gestures. Complete stage directions were
given in the work for the action of the various
characters. The oratorio ended with a
chorus "to be sung, accompanied sedately
and reverentially by the dance," and there
was provision for a ballet, "enlivened with
capers or <i>entrechats</i>."</p>

<p>The new form of religious drama soon
won its way to general appreciation, and
composers were not slow to avail themselves
of the opportunities it gave them.
Giovanni Carissimi (1582-1672) wrote a
number of oratorios, excellent for their
time, among them "Jephthah," "Solomon's
Judgment," "Belshazzar," and "David and
Jonathan." Carissimi made great improvements
in the recitative, giving it more character
and real musical expressiveness than
his predecessors had. He also showed
much skill in his choral writing, which was
not so completely polyphonic as that of the
earlier church writers. He often used bold
successions of broad and simple chords and
often his writing for the voices is much like
that of Handel, a century later. On the
whole his work shows a tendency to abandon
a close adherence to the methods of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
early opera composers and to move toward
the style subsequently formulated by Handel.
Alessandro Stradella (1645(?)-1681(?))
and Antonio Cesti (1620-?), the latter,
a pupil of Carissimi, did much toward developing
the choral part of the oratorio.
Dr. Parry says: "Stradella had a very remarkable
instinct for choral effect, and even
piling up progressions into a climax; and
his solo music, though apparently not so
happy in varieties of spontaneous melody
as Cesti's, aims equally at definiteness of
structure. His work in the line of oratorio
is especially significant, as he stands comparatively
alone in cultivating all the natural
resources of that form of art&mdash;on the lines
which Handel adopted later&mdash;at a time
when his fellow composers were falling in
with the inclination of their public for solo
singing, and were giving up the grand opportunities
of choral effect as superfluous."</p>

<p>The tendency of dramatic music, the state
of public taste, and the skill of solo singers
all had their influence upon oratorio during
the sixteenth century, and the most popular
oratorio composers were those who also
wrote the most successful operas. Alessandro
Scarlatti, who has been mentioned
earlier in this book, was the musical dictator
of his day, and his oratorios show a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
great gain in the elasticity and direct expressiveness
of the recitative, which is quite as
dramatic as that of the contemporaneous
opera. But perhaps his treatment of the
aria was more influential. It was he who
made the aria the central sun of the operatic
system, and he naturally gave to the solo
parts of his oratorios more definiteness of
melody. His treatment of the aria, with its
passages of pure vocal display combined
with clearly formed tune, led the way directly
to the Handelian style.</p>

<p>George Frederick Handel was born at
Halle, Germany, Feb. 23, 1685. He
studied first under Zachau of Halle, and
began his musical career as an opera composer
at Hamburg. He went to Italy and
studied faithfully the works of the Italian
masters, some of whom (the Scarlattis,
Corelli, and others) he met personally. His
three years in Italy saturated him with the
spirit of Italian music, and he was always
influenced by it. On his return to Germany
he became chapel master to the Elector of
Hanover. In 1710 he made his first visit
to England and wrote his opera "Rinaldo."
In 1712 he went to live in England, where
he remained till his death, April 13, 1759.
Handel, having failed pecuniarily as an
opera composer, took up the work of oratorio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
writing. His principal oratorios are:
"The Messiah" (Dublin, April 18, 1742,
and London, 1749), "Israel in Egypt" (1740)
"Judas Maccabæus" (1747), and "Saul"
(1740). The oratorio as we know it today
dates from Handel, and it was in his day
that Dr. Gibson, Bishop of London, gave a
decision which put an end to acting in this
branch of art and removed it entirely from
the realm of dramatic representation.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with Handel was Sebastian
Bach (1685-1750) who is believed to
have made five different settings of the story
of Christ's passion. Of these only two have
been preserved: that according to St. John
(1724), and that according to St. Matthew
(1729). The latter is regarded as the greater,
and is esteemed by most critics as the noblest
of all compositions in the oratorio form.
The reader has seen how the oratorio in
Italy developed up to the time of Handel,
who took up that line of progress and advanced
it. His oratorios are strictly in the
line of Italian development, with such modifications
as the character and nationality of
the man would naturally produce. We shall
best understand the subsequent development
of oratorio if we now review the history of
passion music and examine the peculiar character
of this product as compared with the
oratorio of Handel.</p>

<p class="cap">THE history of passion music previous
to that of Bach is voluminous.
Early in the middle ages the history of the
passion according to the four evangelists
was sung on the four days of Holy Week.
This was done in the Roman Catholic
churches. A priest intoned the words of
the narrative, a second priest the words of
Christ, and a third those of the other personages
in the story. The words of the
populace, the crowd, were sung by the
choir in the polyphony of the time. The
Protestant authorities saw the value of
this form of service as a means of impressing
the story upon the popular mind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
continued its use, but with German instead
of Latin text. As early as 1530 there
were passions according to St. Matthew and
St. John, with German text and music by
Johann Walther. The first published edition
is a passion according to St. Matthew,
with music by Clemens Stephani, printed
at Nuremberg in 1570. Various versions
written by Melchior Vulpius, in 1613,
Thomas Mancinus, 1620, and Christopher
Schulz, 1653, are known.</p>

<p>An important contribution to the development
of passion music was that of Heinrich
Schütz (born at Köstritz, Saxony, Oct. 8,
1585, died at Dresden, Nov. 6, 1672).
Schütz was a pupil of Giovanni Gabrieli, of
the Venetian school of organists, and was
made chapel master at Dresden by the Elector
George I. In his "Seven Last Words of
Christ" (produced in 1645) we find a fusing
of all the elements which appear in the
earlier passion music, and also a definite foundation
for the form employed by Bach.
The work begins with a four-part chorus set
to the words of the old hymn:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"Since Christ our Lord was crucified
<br />
And bore the spear-wound in his side."</p>

<p>An instrumental "symphony" follows
and leads up to a recitative by the Evangelist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
(alto voice) who tells the story:
"And it was close upon the third hour
when they crucified the Lord, and Jesus
spake." The words of Christ are then
sung by a baritone: "Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do." The
narrative is not confined to one voice,
tenor and soprano also taking part in it.
The words "And at about the ninth hour
he cried aloud and said" are set for a
quartet. So also are the words "And after
he had thus spoken," etc. An instrumental
symphony follows the close of the
story, "And he gave up his spirit," and
the work ends with a chorus expressing
the thoughts of the Christian Church. Significant
features of this work are its use of
recitative instead of plain chant, which was
used in the narrative and recitative parts
of the earlier Passions, its preservation of
choruses of the old polyphonic motet style,
its employment of a carefully made instrumental
accompaniment, and its introduction
of the two picturesque orchestral interludes.
Schütz's recitative, it should be noted, was not
so much like the modern oratorio recitative
as like the arioso style,&mdash;that in which
the recitation has a melodious character.</p>

<p>In the years 1665 and 1666 Schütz produced
four settings of the Passion. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
these the composer, in an effort to combat
the growing influence of Italian opera music
in Germany, abandoned the instrumental
accompaniment and wrote his choruses in
the pure <i>a capella</i> church style. But his
individual characters, the evangelist, Christ,
and others, used dramatic recitative. The
Passion music of Giovanni Sebastiani,
written in 1672, approaches the form of
Bach's very closely. The Evangelist, who
tells the story in a recitative of melodious
character, is a tenor, and his recitation is
accompanied by 2 violins, viola, and bass.
The sacred aria makes its appearance in this
setting, and so also does the four-part Protestant
chorale. This introduction of the
chorale grew out of the custom, which had
formerly prevailed, of asking the congregation
at convenient points in the Passion to
sing a hymn.</p>

<p>There were other versions of the Passion,
but that which most concerns us at
present was an arrangement of the text
in 1712 by Barthold Heinrich Brockes, a
member of the Town Council of Hamburg.
This was set to music by several
composers, among them Handel, and it
was known to Sebastian Bach. This text
appears to the taste of the present to be
overloaded with ornate figures of speech.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
The reader may now be able to perceive
the differences between the form and style
of the oratorio proper as cultivated by
Handel and of the Passion oratorio, as a
special variety, cultivated by Bach. In
the St. Matthew Passion, the master-work
of Bach, the narrative part of the text,
according to the writings of Matthew, is
sung by a tenor in a form of recitative.
The speeches of Jesus, St. Peter, the High
Priest, and Pontius Pilate are always delivered
by a bass. The Jews are represented
by a chorus. A second group,
representing the ideal Christian congregation,
introduces moral observations, while
a third group sings chorales, representing
the spirit of Protestantism.</p>

<p>In Handel's "Messiah" the text, taken
from various parts of the Bible, gives an
outline of the story of the coming of the
Saviour, of his suffering and death. There
are solos by tenor, soprano, alto, and bass
voices, which are used entirely for musical
effect. There is no attempt to identify
any voice with any personage. "He was
despised and rejected" is sung by the alto;
"I know that my Redeemer liveth," by
the soprano; "But who may abide the
day of His coming?" by the bass. The
entire treatment of the text is regulated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
musical considerations. It is not possible
to discover that the chorus represents the
populace or the church. For instance, the
bass sings the air "The people that walked
in darkness have seen a great light" with
text from Isaiah; and this is followed by
the chorus "For unto us a son is born"
from the same book. Then comes the
pastoral symphony, a bit of purely descriptive
instrumental music, which serves as a
prelude to the scene of the shepherds, which
is narrated by a soprano voice. This
wholly undramatic style is not unlike the
purely musical manner of setting the mass
and the other parts of the church liturgy,
and has been closely followed in its form
by modern composers in many works in
which the element of personality is not a
factor. It was followed by Handel himself
in some of his other works, by Haydn
in "The Seasons," and by Mendelssohn in
his "St. Paul" to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>But Handel himself thoroughly understood
the value of the old-fashioned form
of Carissimi, in which the personages
were treated dramatically and uttered direct
speeches. The familiar number, "Total
Blindness," from his "Samson," is an example
of this. But the difference between
the oratorios of Handel and Bach is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
merely one of form. It is still more noticeable
in the style and the spirit. The Handelian
oratorio, although it may not at first
sight appear to be so, is a direct descendant
of the Italian. Handel was completely saturated
with the spirit of Italian music, and he
developed his musical style from it. It was
plainly his purpose in building the great
choruses of his oratorios to follow the ecclesiastical
polyphonic style of Italy. But this
in itself had undergone certain technical
changes. In the first place, the disappearance
of the old church scales and the introduction
of the modern major and minor
keys had placed polyphony on a new basis
and compelled a more free and unrestricted
treatment of the voice parts in order that
the new laws of harmony might not be
broken. Again the old church choruses
were designed for performance without accompaniment,
while the oratorio choruses
had to follow the later custom and make
use of the orchestra. Hence Handel's
polyphony had to be cast in broader and
more powerful masses, while his orchestral
accompaniment had a certain amount of independence,
and at times even considerable descriptive
power. His entire musical scheme,
however, was devised to reproduce in broad
tints the emotional spirit of the text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Handel's choruses are full of musical characterization,
and it is this spirit, even more
than the style, which distinguishes them
from those of his Italian forerunners, and
which has made them stand the test of
time and manifold changes of musical taste.
"The Messiah" is the most popular oratorio
in the United States, because its broad
mass effects are instantly influential, even
among those who neither perceive their
musical character nor comprehend their artistic
purpose. Strongly marked rhythms,
fluent melody, and powerful climaxes are
among the easily discernible elements of
the greatness of Handel's choruses, but the
deeper secret of their power is their admirable
adaptation of old means to the promptings
of a new spirit. Handel never forgot
his public, however, and it is largely because
he kept always before him the necessity of
achieving his artistic purposes with attractive
means that his "Messiah" continues
to be popular. The fundamental elements
of popularity in music do not change radically,
after all, and hence Handel's music
holds its own in the absence from the domain
of oratorio of anything of a more
influential nature.</p>

<p>Two great characteristics mark the difference
between Bach's work in the development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of oratorio and Handel's. In the
first place Bach was essentially German in
thought and practice, and in the second
place he cared comparatively little about
producing beautiful melody and attractive
musical effects, but devoted his energies to
the most accurate, detailed, and subtle expression.
The Teutonism of Bach's music
is to be seen not only in the intense earnestness
and high intellectuality of it, but in
its wide and significant employment of the
German chorale and of a musical style
developed therefrom. As Dr. Parry has
noted, Bach's early life was given up to the
study of organ playing, and hence the voice parts
in his choruses follow the method
of organ counterpoint. His choruses are,
therefore, not so broad and massive as
Handel's, but present a more scholarly and
varied polyphony. "Where Handel aimed
at beauty of melodic form, Bach strove for
characteristic expression." Handel's counterpoint
is the smooth, mellifluous, facile
counterpoint of the Italians; Bach's, seeking
always to fit the musical phrase to the
immediate context, is severe, intricate, and
evasive. Its demands on the hearer present
themselves as a series of numberless details,
demanding of him unusual closeness of attention
and delicacy of perception. Handel's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
melodic form and mass effects are
easily appreciable by the masses; Bach requires
more attention than the masses ever
give, but he repays study with a revelation
of great riches. To sum up this part
of the matter, Handel was Italian in his
knowledge of how to please, while Bach
was German in his conscientiousness and
thoroughness.</p>

<p>The employment of the German chorale
in Bach's Passion music was not only the
result of his adherence to established custom,
but the outcome of his life-long devotion to
this characteristic embodiment of the spirit
of Protestant Germany. Bach treated the
chorale melodies in many of his works, such
as his organ chorales and his motets, as the
medieval composers treated the <i>cantus firmus</i>,
the liturgical chant. He used it as the subject
of a contrapuntal work, weaving around it
a rich, yet austere polyphony, which voiced
the plain methods of the Protestant Church
as fully as the medieval counterpoint reflected
in music the artistic method pictorially embodied
in Gothic architecture. It was altogether
natural and fitting that when he came
to set the Passion he should have used the
chorale as the most complete and satisfying
exponent of the Protestant faith, for that was
what it had come to be in Germany. To this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
day the Lutheran hymn "Ein feste Burg ist
unser Gott" is the battle-hymn of the German
Protestant.</p>

<p>Bach lacked the impulse of the Italian to
write tune for tune's sake. Striving as he did
"for characteristic expression," it was impossible
for him to reach a simple song-style
in the solo parts of his Passion. His recitative
is too intricate, too detailed, and too
thoughtful to produce the broad declamatory
effects of Handel's. The same assertion may
be made as to his airs. Bach's music always
has a reflective quality which robs it of the
conventional dramatic appearance and stands
as an obstacle in the way of its immediate appreciation
by a miscellaneous and unprepared
audience. There is nothing popular about
Bach's music. He never comes down from
his elevation to meet the crowd. If you
wish to understand Bach you must climb up
to his height, and that is never easy to do.</p>

<p>Both the forms, that of Handel and that
of Bach, have individuality and distinct limitations.
Bach's style, capable as it is of intense
feeling, is essentially intimate, personal,
and undramatic. It is always the voice of
Bach in direct address to you that you hear.
Handel's method is productive of broad and
imposing effects, and while it is frequently
only theatrical, it is quite as often sincerely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and convincingly dramatic. One of Handel's
biographers says of his great choruses:
"They are choral recitatives, uttered by the
voice of a multitude instead of a man. And
strangely enough, the path that led to this
embodiment of the composer's aspirations
was the dusty path of Italian opera, where
great combinations were impossible, science
all but wasted, and where a giant intellect
found little to grasp." Yet it is precisely
the development of Handel's oratorio
style from his work as an Italian opera composer
that establishes its direct connection
with the progress of the original Italian
school of oratorio founded in Rome. It was
the outcome, the climax, and the end of
this school. Bach's Passion oratorios were
the product of a purely German and Protestant
ancestry, and they, too, were the highest
achievement of their school. The subsequent
history of oratorio will show us how
attempts were made to fuse the elements of
the two schools.</p>

<h3>Haydn and Mendelssohn</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Decadence of oratorio after Handel and Bach&mdash;Haydn and

contemplative&mdash;Mendelssohn and the fusion of styles&mdash;His

of elements from Handel and Bach.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">FOR a considerable period after the deaths
of Handel and Bach nothing of note in
oratorio form was produced. One must seek
for the cause of this in the vitiated state of
public taste. Europe was addicted to the
Italian opera habit, and in those days Italian
opera was quite as empty, meaningless, and
insincere as it has been at most periods in its
history. There were no Italian composers
who had sufficient genius to combine dramatic
truth with musical beauty, so those who were
writing contented themselves with the easily
attainable, and turned out watery arias to
please the superficial multitude. It was much
easier for people to listen to that sort of music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
than to the imposing works of Handel or the
subtle productions of Bach. Indeed the work
of the latter was not known far outside of
his own country. The large and comprehensive
"History of Music," by Sir John
Hawkins, published in 1776, when England
was not yet through mourning the loss of
Handel, contains a very brief mention of
Bach, and says nothing at all about his Passions.
They indeed were quite forgotten till
Mendelssohn found that according to St.
Matthew and resurrected it a hundred years
after it was written. In the meantime Sacchini,
Paisiello, Jomelli, and other Italian
opera composers, whose works are now as
dead as the Pharaohs, were writing worthless
oratorios in operatic style.</p>

<p>Josef Haydn (1732-1813) began his career
as an oratorio composer by writing an Italian
work, in 1774, called "Il ritorno di Tobia."
It was in the accepted form of its time, and
though it contained some melodious solo
parts and some well made fugal choruses, it
shared the fate of other oratorios in the same
style and sank into oblivion. Before Haydn
reached the closing years of his life, however,
two influences combined to change the public
attitude toward operatic and oratorio music.
Gluck had made a determined stand against
the meaningless jingle of Italian opera music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and had shown how to write operas which
should be simple, melodious, and dramatically
honest. Mozart had taken the entire extant
apparatus of Italian opera and shown how it
could be made the vehicle of the fullest dramatic
expression and the most faithful characterization.
The people in general were led
to revolt against the employment of the unsuitable
style of the old-fashioned opera in
church music, of which they felt oratorio was
a close connection. They saw that if Italian
opera music was unfit for the stage, it was
certainly less suited to a form closely allied
to worship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Haydn had been in London
and had heard some of Handel's oratorios.
The knowledge gained therefrom he was now
to put to good use in constructing the choruses
of his new works. His own developments
in orchestration had been supplemented by
Mozart's revelation of the wide possibilities
of tone-coloring, and Haydn, equipped with
all this knowledge, was to make a most important
contribution to the growth of oratorio
in its orchestral department. In the latter
days of his great career, in 1798, Haydn produced
"The Creation," a work which has
survived its worthless predecessors of the
post-Handelian period, and which is welcomed
today wherever music lovers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
not lost their ability to appreciate simplicity
and unpretentious beauty. In form "The
Creation" is much more closely allied to the
epic form of "The Messiah" than the dramatic
shape of "Samson" and other works.
The solo parts of "The Creation" are assigned
to persons in the drama, as Adam and
Eve, but these persons have no dramatic
character or function. Their voices are employed
only as those of narrators or commentators.
They narrate the events of creation
and comment on its wonders. The reader
will at once see that this method deprived the
work of the powerful element of personal
characterization. The emotions of Adam
and Eve never come to the surface. There
is no passion, no grief in "The Creation."
Thus it makes a step backward toward the
music of pure religious contemplation, such
as we found at the close of the era of church
counterpoint. But Haydn's means were
more modern. His arias for the solo voices
have all the beauty of melody and style to be
found in the best Italian writing for the stage,
while they add to these elements a sincerity
never wanting in the music of Haydn.</p>

<p>The choruses are naturally designed on a
less imposing scale than those of Handel,
which, as we have seen, had a certain dramatic
quality. The general style and purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of Haydn's oratorio writing made it
inevitable that his choruses should be more
contemplative or descriptive and less dramatic,
and his development of the instrumental
accompaniment emphasized this
condition. It was Haydn who introduced
into the oratorio purely descriptive orchestral
music, and in doing this he paved the way
for later composers to make stronger dramatic
effects. Descriptive music in the
orchestra, and instrumental accompaniments
with special significance, are now a familiar
part of the apparatus of the lyric drama as
well as of the oratorio. Haydn employed
these means as a part of his general scheme
of descriptive writing. In order to give his
instrumental description full scope, he was
obliged to cast his choruses in a simpler
mould than those of Handel, but his contributions
to the art of descriptive writing
were quite as valuable within their field as
Handel's to the art of building huge choral
climaxes. The prelude to "The Creation"
is an instrumental representation of chaos;
in the recitative beginning "And God made
the firmament" are instrumental illustrations
of storms, winds, thunders, and floods; the
air "Rolling in foaming billows" has an
accompaniment designed to suggest to the
hearer the movement of waves. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
were Haydn's original devices, and as such,
although they sound simple and even naive
to us today, they claim an important place
in the advancement of musical art.</p>

<p>Haydn's second oratorio, "The Seasons,"
was produced in 1801, and although the
composer's powers failed rapidly thereafter,
there is no evidence of weakness in this
work. In all essentials the form and style
of this oratorio, which is secular, being
founded in Thomson's poem of the same
name, are the same as those of "The Creation."
It is a descriptive, contemplative
work, and must please by its thoughtful
beauty and illustrative power. It is without
the dramatic element. Ludwig Spohr
(1784-1859) wrote oratorios, one of which,
called "The Last Judgment"&mdash;though its
name literally means "The Last Things"
has some claims to consideration, inasmuch
as by reason of its purely contemplative
method and its instrumental descriptions it
stands in the direct line of oratorio progress.
It is, however, not frequently performed.
It was produced at Cassel in 1826.</p>

<p>We come now to the master who established
a new form of oratorio,&mdash;a form
which is unsurpassed in its possibilities, and
in which he left us the greatest masterpiece
of dramatic oratorio. Felix Mendelssohn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
(1809-1847) wrote two oratorios: "St. Paul,"
produced in 1836, and "Elijah," first performed
in 1846. Though Mendelssohn was
never a writer for the stage, for which his
style was not at all suitable, he was not undramatic
in his musical instincts. He was
inordinately fond of programme music, and
was somewhat more inclined to attribute to
music a definite directness of utterance than
most thoughtful commentators are willing
to concede to it. He certainly went far
toward justifying his theories by his "Midsummer
Night's Dream" overture, but one
must be careful to note that this composition
is almost wholly made up of what has
happily been called scenic music,&mdash;music
descriptive of the externals of a drama, not
of its subtler emotions. That Mendelssohn,
however, had on the whole the right conception
of the expressive power of music
is shown by his reproof of the man who
tried to give titles to the "Songs Without
Words," and by his quotation of the opening
measures of his own Hebrides overture
as his attempt to express his own feelings
aroused by the winds and waves. On the
whole, it must be conceded that Mendelssohn
had a correct idea of the dramatic
expressiveness of music and a deep sympathy
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
At the same time Mendelssohn, though
of Jewish blood, was intensely German.
Furthermore, he was baptized and brought
up as a Protestant Christian. It is not at
all surprising, then, that he was prepared to
be powerfully attracted toward the Protestant
oratorio, when he approached that
form of composition, and to show little
sympathy for the Italian form, as perfected
by Handel. As early as 1823 the score of
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" was copied
from the manuscript and placed in his hands
for study. It is not difficult to imagine the
effect of the work on the mind of an eager,
ambitious boy of fourteen, already a composer,
and just passed through the severe
process of German preparation for confirmation.
Mendelssohn became an enthusiastic
propagandist of the teachings of Bach, and
revived the "St. Matthew Passion" in
Germany, where the general public had
quite forgotten it.</p>

<p>In preparing himself for the task of composing
his first oratorio, "St. Paul," Mendelssohn
undoubtedly gave close study to
the works of his great predecessors. That
he should have rejected almost instinctively
the Italian style of Handel followed as a
matter of course. That he should have put
aside with equal readiness the austere style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of Bach was inevitable. Mendelssohn was
from the outset an exponent of graceful,
fluent melody. His genius was deeply
tinged with the sentiment of song, and he
could no more have sacrificed beauty of
theme and perfect simplicity of form to subtlety
of detail than Handel could. But at
the same time his dramatic instincts told him
that the sure way to the hearts of the people
was the old Italian way, which made
the oratorio in all essentials, except scenery
and action, a religious drama. He knew
at once that Bach's method of presenting
the speeches of the principal personages in
direct recitative was good, but that it had
fallen short of complete effectiveness from
two reasons: first, because the speeches
were led up to and quoted by the evangelist
narrator; and second, because the musical
character of the recitative was too detailed
to appeal to a general audience. But Mendelssohn
saw one tremendous factor in the
Bach oratorio,&mdash;the chorale as an embodiment
of the Protestant faith of Germany.</p>

<p>In his "St. Paul" he did not arrive at
the true method of dealing with the elements
which appeared to him to be essential
to an influential and permanent form
of oratorio. The book is episodic and lacks
dramatic continuity. The plan is religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
rather than dramatic. The martyrdom of
St. Stephen is the first episode, and it is
without direct connection dramatically with
the other two, the conversion of St. Paul,
and his later career as a preacher. Both
Stephen and Paul are deficient in definiteness
of characterization. They appear to us
rather as representations of an idea, which
may be expressed in the words, "Go ye unto
all the world and preach the gospel." But
in "Elijah" we have the genuine modern
dramatic oratorio, and in it we find that
Mendelssohn made use of those parts of
the apparatus of his predecessors suitable
to his designs. "Elijah" is eclectic. It
is a fusion of forms and styles, made with
great skill and with the finest possible discrimination.
It is a logical evolution, and
Mendelssohn showed in its composition an
instinctive grasp of the evolutionary principle
of the survival of the fittest,&mdash;that is,
the fittest for his design.</p>

<p>He dispensed with the narrator and directed
his attention to placing the speeches
of his personages before the auditor in the
most direct, dramatic, and characteristic
manner. He used the choruses as Handel
did, to impersonate the mass of people. He
employed the chorales exactly as Bach
did, to signify the thought of the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
as it had come to be understood in Germany.
His scenes are all arranged in dramatic
form, and without doubt could be
placed upon the stage effectively if the
whole feeling of contemporaneous audiences
were not opposed to that method of giving
oratorio. His characters are drawn clearly
and sharply. Indeed, there is no oratorio
in which the musical characterization is so
finely worked out. The contrasts between
the choruses of the priests of Baal and the
Jews are sufficient evidence of this. But
everywhere throughout the score there is
evidence of a consistent and successful effort
to adapt to the production of a powerfully
dramatic, yet specifically Protestant and
German, oratorio, the most influential elements
of the forms of Handel and Bach,
together with Haydn's instrumental coloring.</p>

<p>The very beginning of the oratorio strikes
a new note, and one of tremendous dramatic
power. Three broad chords are followed
by the portentous prophecy of Elijah, "As
God the Lord of Israel liveth, before whom
I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain
these years, but according to my word."
After that single passage, set to a style of
recitative wholly different from that of either
Bach or Handel, yet containing some of the
qualities of both, follows the overture, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
piece of music descriptive of the misery of
the land of drought. Thenceforward everything
moves dramatically. The people cry,
"Help, Lord; wilt Thou quite destroy
us?" Then they beseech, "Lord, bow
Thine ear to our prayer." Obadiah calls
them to repentance with warning and with
the lovely air, "If with all your hearts ye
truly seek me." Later an angel comes and
commands Elijah to go to Cherith's brook,
and then follows the double quartet, "For
He shall give His angels," a new employment
of Bach's commentary chorus. The
episode of Elijah and the widow is treated
with dramatic directness, and is followed by
the commentary chorus, "Blessed are the
men who fear Him."</p>

<p>The whole scene between Elijah and the
priests of Baal is magnificent in the eloquence
of its dramatic form and style. Yet
the superb air of Elijah, "Lord God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, this day let it
be known that Thou art God," is followed
by the pure old Bach species of chorale,
"Cast thy burden upon the Lord." The
climax of the oratorio is reached in the
great scene of the coming of the rain. This
scene is constructed and composed with a
fine sense of dramatic values, and its effect
is so sure and strong that it puts before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
imagination a vivid picture. It is no wonder
that in England, where dry and dusty works
are produced year after year by native composers,
such a masterpiece as "Elijah" is
always heard with unabated enthusiasm.
Here it is overshadowed in the popular
mind by "The Messiah," and perhaps this
is due in some measure to the public absorption
in opera.</p>

<p>Since Mendelssohn achieved his fusion of
the most influential elements of the Italian
and German oratorios, no significant advance
has been made in the oratorio form. This,
of course, is due to the fact that no musician
of genius has found in that form a vehicle
suitable to the character of his thought.
Good, workmanlike compositions have been
produced in England, where oratorio is more
popular than it is in any other part of the
world, but so far as can be judged from the
disadvantageous position of close proximity
to the novelties, nothing of large worth has
been written there. It seems safe to say,
however, that the greatest choral composition
written since Mendelssohn's day is the
German Requiem of Brahms. But it lies
outside the field of oratorio. Edgar Tinel,
born at Sinay, Belgium, on March 27, 1854,
has made an attempt to return directly to the
Italian dramatic form of Carissimi, but employing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
modern musical material. His oratorio,
"St. Franciscus," produced in Brussels
in 1888, employs the entire musical apparatus
of modern German opera, including
the full resources of Wagnerian orchestration.
The result is that the music smells of the
theatre, and the whole style of the work is
foreign to the religious atmosphere of the
oratorio. Charles François Gounod (1818-1893),
the famous French opera composer,
made an attempt in his "Redemption" to
produce a modernized treatment of Bach's
passion form. Gounod was always a student
of Bach, and was thoroughly acquainted with
the various forms employed by that master.
In "The Redemption" he followed the
Bach plan of giving the narrative to one or
two separate male voices and having the
direct speeches of Jesus quoted by a baritone.
He employs the chorale to represent the voice
of the Church, while modern chorus forms
are used to represent the crowd. Gounod
also uses a single typical theme to embody
the love of Jesus, and this, of course, is a device
of later date than Bach. But the ground
plan of "The Redemption" is plainly modelled
on that of the "St. Matthew Passion." There
the resemblance ends, for Gounod's recitative
and choral writings are modern and sweetly
melodious without subtlety.</p>

<p class="cap">THE modern opera was the result of a
deliberate attempt to revive the Greek
drama, and that attempt was caused chiefly
by dissatisfaction with the music of medieval
festival plays. The direction of the attempt
was guided by the revival of Greek learning
in Italy, a revival of which the reader
has already been informed in Chapter VI.
In order, however, that the reader may
have a clear understanding of the conditions
which led to the birth of opera, it
is necessary that the author should briefly
review the state of vocal music employed in
plays in the sixteenth century. The reader
will best understand this by recollecting that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the entire art music of the time was colored
by the use of the ecclesiastical scales and the
complete devotion of composers to church
counterpoint. The result was that in the
beginning there was no difference, except in
the subjects of the libretti, between the
religious dramas, from which the oratorio
was developed, and the secular plays with
music, which may be regarded as the forerunners
of the opera. These plays contained
no recitative, because recitative had not yet
been invented. They consisted of dialogue
interspersed with choruses, and these choruses
were always written, like the madrigals
and other secular songs of the time, in one
or the other of the ecclesiastical scales and
in three, four, or five part polyphony.</p>

<p>Accounts have come down to us from a
time as early as 1350 of the employment of
plays with musical accompaniment performed
to bring to a close the carnival festivities in
Florence. This accompaniment at first consisted
of a single chorus sung at the end of
a scene, to a text bearing some relation to
that of the play. The absurdity into which
it fell at times may be understood from the
fact that the text sung in a polyphonic chorus
was frequently supposed to be the utterance
of one of the personages of the drama.
Toward the end of the fourteenth century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the custom of introducing these pieces of
music grew until they were known as intermezzi.
The intermezzo grew in importance
till it became a separate play of lighter character
than the principal drama. As our
fathers used to go to the theatre to see
"Richard III.," followed by a one act farce,
so these medieval Italians went to see a
serious drama relieved by a humorous
or fanciful intermezzo; the difference being
that the intermezzo was performed between
the acts of the play. The intermezzo
subsequently rose to such an importance
that it developed into opera buffa, the comic
Italian opera. But for the present we are
concerned with it only as a forerunner of
opera.</p>

<p>In 1589 Giovanni Bardi, Count of Vernio,
wrote, as the festival play for the marriage
of the Grand Duke Ferdinand with
Christine de Lorraine, "L'Amico fido" with
"grand, spectacular intermezzi." There were
five intermezzi: "The Harmony of the
Spheres," by Rinuccini, Cavaliere, and Malvezzi;
"The Judgment of the Hamadryads,"
by Rinuccini and Marenzio; "The Triumph
of Apollo," by Rinuccini, Marenzio, and
Vernio; "The Infernal Regions," by Strozzi
and Caccini; and "The Fable of Arion," by
Rinuccini, Cavaliere and Marenzio. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
production naturally stimulated the movement
in the direction of true opera, while
it served to emphasize the utter unfitness
of the extant style of music for dramatic
purposes. The more frequently the composers
undertook to set to music dramatic
libretti, even of the simplest nature, the
more firmly they became convinced that
their music was not the right kind. The
musical artists of the time had followed the
methods of the religious drama, described in
the chapter on the birth of oratorio, and were
now gradually awakening to the fact that its
style of music was incapable of illustrating
the human passions and emotions of the
secular drama. The dissatisfaction first found
general voice in 1579, when a festival play,
with music by Claudio Merulo and Andrea
Gabrieli, was performed in honor of the
marriage of Francesco I., Duke of Tuscany,
with Bianca Capella, of Venice. The text
of the choruses was full of joyous praise of
the beauty of the bride; the music was in
strict canon and in four parts, and made the
wedding songs sound like funeral hymns.
The artistic nobility of Florence was deeply
displeased, and it was then that the Count
of Vernio and a circle of his friends set out
to see how they could improve the state of
dramatic music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
The reader will recollect that in Chapter
VI I spoke of the great influence of the
revival of Greek learning in Italy on the
simplification of musical style. The friends
and associates of Count Vernio were all
enthusiastic students of Greek literature;
and to them the masterpieces of Æschylus
and Euripides had come as revelations. It
became their fondest ambition to restore the
Greek drama, but they soon learned that in
order to do this they must find their way
back to something like the Greek music
used in that drama. It was in searching
for this that they hit upon the much desired
substitute for the unsuitable polyphonic
choruses. The Greek drama resembled the
opera rather than the play of the present
day. Music was an essential part of it.
The dramatic and lyric elements were inseparable,
and the one modified the other.
The spirit of the text was as faithfully represented
in the music as it was possible to
represent it with the music of that age.
We have abundant evidence that the Greek
tragic writers were also composers. H. E.
Krehbiel, in his "Studies in the Wagnerian
Drama," has excellently summarized this
evidence. A fragment of a theoretical work
on rhythm by Aristoxenus is filled with lamentations
over the decadence of dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
music since the days of Æschylus. The
author accuses contemporary composers of
pandering to a depraved public taste. Sophocles
was not only a poet and a composer, but
an actor and a singer. In his own drama
"Thamyris" he appeared as a singer stricken
blind by the muses. Special note is made
by the Greek writers that Euripides had to
call in the aid of a composer to supply the
music for one of his plays. In the Greek
play the actors did not declaim their lines;
they chanted them. The odes which filled
the pauses between the various stages of
the dramatic action were sung by the
chorus which gravely danced around an
altar between the stage and the audience.
These choruses were sung in unison, and
were accompanied by instruments.</p>

<p>It was this dramatic recitation in music as
practised by the Greeks that the little circle
of enthusiasts, habitually assembled at the
Palazzo Bardi, set out to resuscitate. But
they had no specimens of it and hence were
forced to do the best they could from descriptions.
The most significant fact that
struck home into their minds was that a
single personage sang or intoned his part
alone, and with an accompaniment of lyres
or instruments of that class. Of course solo
singing was not unknown to the medieval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Italians. The troubadours and minstrels
were practising it, and furthermore it is inconceivable
that they themselves did not
often hum the catch of a madrigal. Musical
historians too often speak of solo singing as
if it were a sudden invention of the Bardi
circle. What they did was to begin the
artistic cultivation of it on certain lines and
to produce something which became dramatic
recitative. Vincenzo Galilei, father
of Galileo, the famous astronomer, was a
most enthusiastic advocate of the ancient
music. He entered into a published controversy
with the composer and theorist
Zarlino, who warmly defended the music of
his time. Galilei's "Dialogo della Musica
Antica e Moderna," published in 1581, presents
Count Vernio and Pietro Strozzi, one
of the poets of the Vernio circle, as discussing
ancient and modern music. It seems
strange to us to find Galilei condemning
modern music&mdash;that of the church in 1581&mdash;as
suitable only for uncultivated persons
and not for the scholar. Galilei, however,
was not content with precept; he added
example. He selected a passage from
Dante's "Inferno" and under the title of
"Il Conte Ugolino" he set it to music for a
single voice with lute accompaniment. He
was an admirable lutenist and his performance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
of this, the first artistic monody of
which we have any record, must have been
very effective. The work itself is lost.</p>

<p>Giovanni Battista Doni, in his "Compendio
del Trattato de' Generi e de' Modi
della Musica" (Rome, 1635), tells us that
Galilei was the "first who composed songs
for a single voice," but he declares that
Giulio Caccini, another member of the circle,
"in imitation of Galilei, but in a more beautiful
and pleasing style, set many canzonets
and sonnets written by excellent poets."
Caccini collected a number of these songs,
which are in pure recitative style, and published
them in 1601, under the title of
"Nuove Musiche." He wrote a long preface,
in which he claimed the honor of the
highest achievement in this new kind of
music and stoutly upheld its superiority to
that of the contrapuntists. Here is a specimen
of this "new music," which will give an
excellent idea of the kind of musical recitation
those enthusiasts of Florence evolved from
their attempts to revive the Greek drama.</p>

The bass part is intended to be figured by
the thorough-bass system to indicate the harmonies.
The only point necessary for the
reader to note is that this recitative showed
a tendency to abandon the church scales and
use the modern major and minor keys.
This tendency soon became a fixed practice,
for composers learned from their dramatic
experiments that the church modes were not
suitable to the embodiment of human passions,
and that they also lost much of their
musical effectiveness when not employed in
polyphony. The reader will recollect what
has already been said about the change from
polyphonic to monophonic writing. This
excerpt from Caccini's book is one of the
earliest specimens of monophonic composition,
for it was in the search after the
Greek recitative that composers found the
new thing in music. This particular quotation
presents an unusually well-formed piece
for that time, for most of the music of the
Vernio coterie lacked that definite movement
which we call figure. Its rhythm was exceedingly
vague, for the purpose of the composers
was to follow as closely as possible
the inflections of the voice in speech. It
was their belief that this method was the true
path to dramatic expressiveness. Their theory
has been proved by the experience of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
their successors to be fundamentally correct,
though their practice was naturally uncertain,
tentative, and often unsuccessful. Nevertheless
to Galilei, Caccini, and the other members
of the assembly at the Palazzo Bardi
must be attributed the invention of modern
dramatic recitative, upon which the whole
structure of opera rests. It is not possible
to tell which of these men was the actual
inventor. Probably the product was the
result of consultation and joint effort extending
over some twenty years.</p>

<p>Although the labors of Galilei and Caccini
produced recitative, it is plain that they
had not up to 1595 (or thereabout) written
anything more than scenes for a single voice.
In 1592 the Pope appointed the Count of
Vernio his Maestro di Camera, and he accordingly
removed from Florence to Rome.
The meetings of the Florentine coterie were
held thereafter at the palace of Giacomo
Corsi, who was also an enthusiast in regard
to Greek literature and art in general. It
was at the house of Corsi that the first work
of the coterie in the form of a play was
made known. This was a pastoral called
"Daphne," performed privately in 1597.
The book was written by Ottavio Rinuccini,
the poet, who wrote some of the intermezzi
previously mentioned, and the music was by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Jacopo Peri, a member of the coterie, not a
very learned musician, but a firm believer in
the new style. The work is lost, but Peri
tells us in the preface to his later work,
"Eurydice," that he wrote "Daphne" at
the solicitation of Corsi and Rinuccini to try
the power of the new vocal music. Rinuccini,
in his dedication of the libretto of
"Eurydice" to Mary de Medicis, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has been the opinion of many persons,
most excellent queen, that the ancient Greeks
and Romans sang their tragedies throughout
on the stage, but so noble a manner of recitation
has not, that I know of, been even
attempted by any one till now; and this I
thought was owing to the defect of the
modern music, which is far inferior to the
ancient. But Messer Jacopo Peri made me
entirely alter my opinion, when, upon hearing
the intention of Messer Giacomo Corsi
and myself, he so elegantly set to music the
pastoral of 'Daphne,' which I had composed
merely to make a trial of the power of vocal
music in our age; it pleased to an incredible
degree those few who heard it. From this
I took courage. The same piece, being put
into better form and presented anew in the
house of Messer Peri, was not only favored
by all the nobility of the country, but heard
and commended by the most serene grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
duchess, and the most illustrious Cardinals
dal Monte and Montalto. But the 'Eurydice'
has met with more favor and success,
being set to music by the same Peri with
wonderful art, and having been thought
worthy to be represented on the stage by
the bounty and magnificence of the most
serene grand duke, in the presence of your
Majesty, the cardinal legate, and so many
princes and gentlemen of Italy and France.
From whence, beginning to find how well
musical representations of this kind were
likely to be received, I resolved to publish
these two, to the end that others of greater
abilities than myself may be induced to
carry on and improve this kind of poetry to
such a degree that we may have no occasion
to envy those ancient pieces which are so
much celebrated by noble writers."</p>

<p>It is evident that Rinuccini had a high
opinion of the value of his libretti. Posterity
has awarded the palm, however, to
Peri's music. Peri, in his preface to "Eurydice,"
says he wrote "Daphne" at the suggestion
of Corsi and Rinuccini "to test the
effect of the kind of melody which they imagined
to be the same as that used by the
ancient Greeks and Romans throughout
their dramas." The success of the private
performances of "Daphne" led to the writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of "Eurydice," which was prepared as
the festival play for the marriage of King
Henry IV., of France, with Mary de Medicis.
This work, the first Italian opera, was produced
in 1600 in Florence, after careful preparation.
Its success was immediate and
almost sensational. It was pronounced by
all the dilettanti of Florence to be a genuinely
new thing in art, and the recitative
music, by its fidelity to the text, made a profound
impression. Fortunately this work
has been preserved and there is a modern
reprint of it. In the preface Peri set forth
his theory of recitative. It is evident that
he had a deep insight into the true nature
of the new form. He tried to imitate ordinary
conversational speech with music half
sung and half spoken&mdash;what came to be
called "parlando." More complex emotions
seemed to him to call for a "melody with
greater intervals and a lively tempo, the
accompanying instrumental harmonies changing
more frequently." It appears also from
Peri's preface that he had some assistance
from Caccini in writing his score. But, as
Rinuccini credits Peri alone with the work,
as only Peri's name appeared in the published
score, and as Caccini afterward set
the entire libretto to music of his own, I
suspect that he, being a singer, simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
helped Peri with some of the more troublesome
parts for the solo voices.</p>

<p>The author was present at a performance
of "Eurydice," given by The American
Academy of the Dramatic Arts in New
York on March 15, 1894. The work of
course sounded antiquated and tentative,
and it is impossible for us today to realize
the impression which it must have made on
the Florentines three hundred years ago.
To approach such a realization would require
the power to free one's mind from
familiarity with some of the most ordinary
harmonic and melodic sequences of modern
music, which came into existence after the
days of Peri. One would, furthermore,
have to bring his mind into the state of
those whose only vocal music of an artistic
kind had been contrapuntal and ecclesiastical,
and to whom the vocal solo was a startling
novelty. Viewed from a standpoint as near
this as a modern person can reach, Peri's
recitative&mdash;and his music is never anything
more than recitative&mdash;becomes pregnant
with meaning and fruitful in possibilities.
It certainly sounds somewhat timid to us,
lacking, as it does, the bold melodic sequences
of later music. But it reveals itself
as a sincere and&mdash;within its limits&mdash;successful
artistic effort. It is in some measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
hampered by the antiquated conventionalities
of Rinuccini's book, but we must
remember that he, too, was laboring in the
field of experiment. Here is a specimen
of Peri's recitative, quoted in my "Story of
Music," with harmony arranged by Dr. F.
L. Ritter.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few measures of
their choral writing, the whole opera was in
recitative of this kind. The orchestra in
"Eurydice" consisted of a violin, a large
guitar, a lyre, a large lute, and a harpsichord.
These instruments played a very bald sort
of accompaniment. There was no attempt
at instrumental effects, except in one place
where three flutes were employed to imitate
a pandæan pipe, played by one of the characters.
The whole value of the opera lies
in its vocal part.</p>

<p>In closing this account of the first opera,
I must endeavor to convey to the reader a
clear idea of the peculiarities of its music.
I have already pointed out the fact that the
composer sought to impart dramatic significance
to his music by imitating the inflections
of the voice in speech. Naturally this
method precluded the possibility of arriving
at any definite musical form, such as we
should now call a tune. The composers
of the time had not yet acquired such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
familiarity with the monophonic style as to
understand that, as I have shown earlier in
this book, all single-voiced tunes were dependent
upon a harmonic basis.</p>

<p>Not having a definite succession of chords,
they mixed their harmonies up in unrelated
masses, and the voice parts, built upon those
harmonies, were consequently shapeless.
There being no definitely shaped tunes,
there could not be any strong musical contrasts.
To-day a composer expresses grief
through a slow movement, such as a largo
or an adagio, and usually in a minor key,
while a change to joy is indicated by a
transition to a major key, a lively movement,
and an incisive rhythm. But in Peri's
"Eurydice," where everything is in recitative,
such strong contrast is impossible.
When Orpheus bewails the loss of Eurydice
he does it in recitative which is somewhat
broken and spasmodic in its phrasing;
when he pours out his joy at her recovery,
he does it in recitative which flows more
smoothly and approaches more nearly what
we call melody. But that is as far as Peri
advanced, and it is as far as he could advance
in the then state of monophonic composition.
A good singer can make Peri's recitative
sound fairly expressive. Caccini's
setting of Rinuccini's poem is similar in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
general style to that of Peri. But as skill
in writing homophonic music developed
among instrumental composers, the opera
writers began to see how they could adapt
to their needs some of the new material,
and the development of operatic writing in
the direction of definite forms was remarkably
rapid,&mdash;so rapid, indeed, that it led
dramatic music out of its province, as we
shall see.</p>

<p>It should be noted, before proceeding
further, that Peri called his "Eurydice" a
<i>Tragedia per Musica</i>. The other titles of
the lyric drama in its inception were <i>Drama
per Musica</i>, <i>Melodrama</i>, and <i>Tragicomedia</i>.
It was about 1650 that the title <i>Opera per
Musica</i> was first used, and this was soon
afterward abbreviated to Opera. The new
style of music, the recitative, was called <i>Stile
rappresentativo</i> or <i>Stile parlante</i>.</p>

<p class="cap">THE rapidity with which the new style
advanced may be judged from the
fact that seven years after the production of
"Euridice" we meet with an opera containing
a duet, and a few years later with one
containing instrumental descriptions. The
composer, who appears to have been the first
gifted with a real genius for operatic composition,
was Claudio Monteverde (1568-1651).
Already many other composers had
sought to follow Peri, and Mantua, Bologna,
and Venice became homes of opera.
Monteverde was a student of the old contrapuntal
style, but his entire genius was out
of sympathy with it. He became chapel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
master to the Duke of Mantua, and at his
invitation prepared, as one of the festival
plays for the marriage of Francesco Gonzaga
with Margherita, Infanta of Savoy, in
1647, his "Arianna," which, according to
the testimony of a contemporary, "visibly
moved the whole theatre to tears." The
lament of Arianna over the departure of her
faithless lover must have amazed the public
of that day by its simple, melodious pathos.
It approaches the modern arioso in style,
and is really expressive. So successful was
"Arianna" that Monteverde was asked to
compose another opera for 1608. This was
his "Orfeo," the libretto being on the same
story as that of Peri's "Euridice."</p>

<p>The work begins with a prelude, eight
measures in five part harmony for trumpets
and other instruments, followed by a short
passage of contrasting nature. This is to
be played three times before the rising of
the curtain. After this overture there is
a prologue of five speeches in recitative
delivered by a character called La Musica
Prologo, who represents the genius of music.
In his prologue he invites attention to the
story which he relates. The opera begins
with a recitative by a shepherd, and this is
followed by a five part chorus, with accompaniment
of the full orchestra, consisting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the instruments enumerated in Chapter XI.
The work then proceeds in recitative, varied
by choruses, duets, and trios. There are no
solo arias. The aria form had not yet been
developed. Here is part of a duet from
Monteverde's "Orfeo."</p>

<p>The opera ends with a dance. In his
"Tancredi e Clorinda," an intermezzo produced
in Venice in 1624, Monteverde introduced
special instrumental effects which were
to become of so great importance in opera.
These effects I have already described in
Chapter XI, and it is necessary to add here
only the statement that they were used, not
simply as descriptive of action, but also to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
aid in conveying to the minds of the auditors
the impetuosity and passion of the combatants
in the remarkable scene of the fight.
It gives one something of a shock to find
Monteverde indicating the galloping of horses
and the fierceness of their riders, rudely indeed,
but with the same musical methods as
Wagner employed, with their modern development,
in his "Ride of the Valkyrs."
Monteverde was, indeed, the Wagner of his
time. He broke so completely away from
old conventions that Artusi, a writer of Bologna,
accused him of having lost sight of
the true office of music, "to please the ear."</p>

<p>One of the remarkable things (remarkable
at that time) done by Monteverde was to introduce
the chord of the dominant seventh
unprepared. I shall not undertake to explain
the nature of this novelty in harmony,
lest I merely confuse the lay reader, but shall
ask him to content himself with the statement
that such an introduction produced one
of those sharp dissonances so common in
the music of today, and used to express passion.
Monteverde began to use these dissonances
in his madrigals, of which the Fifth
Book, published in 1599, aroused Artusi's
ire. But the tremendous effect of the dissonant
progressions in "Arianna" quite demolished
all the arguments of the opponents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of the novelty. Their employment was one
of the practices which led directly away from
the tonality of the old ecclesiastical scales and
toward the modern major and minor keys.
Dr. Parry's comments on the work of Monteverde
are so pertinent and so lucid that I
cannot do better than to quote a part of
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The methods of choral art did not provide
for dramatic force or the utterance of
passionate feeling; and under such circumstances
it was natural that Monteverde should
misapply [in his madrigals] his special gifts,
which were all in the direction of dramatic
expression. The new departure, when it
came, was his opportunity. He was not ostensibly
a sharer in the first steps of the movement;
but directly he joined it he entirely
eclipsed all other composers in the field, and
in a few years gave it quite a new complexion.
For whereas the first composers had not
laid any great stress on expression, Monteverde's
instinct and aim were chiefly in that
direction; and he often sought to emphasize
his situations at all costs. His harmonic
progressions are for the most part as incoherent
as those of his predecessors, and, as
might be expected with his peculiar aptitudes,
he did very little for design. But he clearly
had a very considerable sense of stage effect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and realized that mere monotonous recitative
was not the final solution nor even the nucleus
of dramatic music. It is true he introduces
a great quantity of recitative, but he
varies it with instrumental interludes which
now and then have some real point and relevancy
about them; and with passages of solo
music which have definite figure and expression,
and with choruses which are more skilfully
contrived, and to a certain degree more
effective, than those of his predecessors. By
this means he broke up the homogeneous
texture of the scenes into passages of well-defined
diversity, and interested his auditors
with contrast, variety, and conspicuously characteristic
passages, which heighten the impression
of the situation as all stage music
should."</p>

<p>Soon after the production of Monteverde's
"Tancredi e Clorinda" the opera ceased to
be a strictly aristocratic form of entertainment
and became public and popular. In
1637 the Teatro San Cassiano was opened to
the public as a regular opera house. Opera
houses became numerous. Up to 1727 no
less than fifteen operatic enterprises were
started, and up to 1734 four hundred operas
by forty composers had been produced. This,
however, carries us far ahead of the period
which we are now discussing. The statement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
is made merely to show that only those Italian
composers can now be mentioned who made
actual contributions to the development of
the lyric drama.</p>

<p>The next who did so contribute after Monteverde
was his pupil, Francesco Cavalli (1599-1676),
a native of Crema, a town near Venice.
He was at one time chapel master of St.
Mark's. His first opera, "Le Nozze di Tito
e di Peleo," was produced in Venice in 1639.
Its recitatives are varied in style and it has
instrumental interludes, notably one for hunting
horns, of striking character. But it was
in his "Giasone," produced in 1649, that
Cavalli's most influential music appeared.
He was opposed to the banishment of rhythmical
music and song-forms from opera simply
because the Greeks did not have them. Instrumental
forms were beginning to show the
influence of folk-music and the popularity of
the early collections of dance tunes suggested
to Cavalli the possible effectiveness of something
similar in vocal style. In his "Giasone,"
therefore, he foreshadowed the <i>aria
da capo</i> (aria with a repeat at its close of the
passage with which it began) by making a return
to the first part. Cavalli's melodies
show a strong movement toward clearness of
rhythm and definiteness of shape, though the
style continued to be tentative and uncertain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
But it is easy to perceive that even in his day
Italian opera had begun the movement toward
elementary rhythms and harmonies and tunefulness
for tune's sake, which were to be its
special characteristics for more than two centuries.
The improvements in the dramatic
recitative and the choral part of oratorio made
by Carissimi, Cesti, and Stradella (see <a href="#Chapter_XV">Chap.
XV</a>.) also influenced composers of opera.
The general tendency was in the direction of
definitely shaped melodies as a substitute for
the formless recitative of Peri and Monteverde.
The recitative itself became more
characteristic and was diversified with short
arioso passages. Furthermore the accompaniment
of the recitative was much improved.
Peri and Caccini fashioned the slight chords
of their accompaniments to recitative so that
they might be played on one instrument, for
they were jealous of the slightest instrumental
interference with their newly invented <i>stilo
parlante</i>. Monteverde improved the instrumental
part of opera, as we have seen, and
frequently accompanied his solo parts with
small groups of instruments. Meanwhile
Giovanni Gabrieli wrote his church music
with orchestral accompaniment, and the opera
composers began to see how grand dramatic
effects might be produced by using similar
means. The result is that in the latter half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of the sixteenth century we find different
kinds of recitative clearly defined and the <i>aria
da capo</i> thoroughly established. The composer
who exhibited the most complete mastery
of these forms, and who was so influential
that he became the founder of the great Neapolitan
school of opera writers, was Alessandro
Scarlatti.</p>

<p>He was born at Trapani in Sicily in 1659.
The record of his early life is lost, but his
career as a famous composer seems to have
been fairly begun when he produced his opera
"Pompeo" at Naples in 1684. He wrote
115 operas, of which 41 are extant in score.
They have all ceased to be performed, but
their historical interest is great. Scarlatti
died Oct. 24, 1725. It is hardly necessary
for the purposes of this volume to specify in
which operas the special features which he
contributed to the development of the form
are to be found. It will perhaps be more
instructive to the reader to enumerate these
features and explain them. Scarlatti made a
systematic distinction of the characteristics of
three kinds of vocal music in opera. Two
of these were recitative, which had hitherto
been treated in one way, the accompaniment
being confined to a small group of instruments,
or one instrument alone, playing
chords. In one of Scarlatti's operas appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
recitative accompanied by the whole orchestra,
and he made a clear distinction in the character
and purpose of two kinds of recitative.
The first of these was the <i>recitativo secco</i>,
which means "dry recitative." This is the
pure dialogue form of recitative, used to carry
on the ordinary passing conversation of the
scene. It was accompanied in the early
works by the harpsichord generally, and it is
the custom to this day in artistic opera
houses to play the chords to the <i>recitativo
secco</i> in "Don Giovanni" on the piano. In
England it became the custom to play these
chords in broken form on the double bass
and violoncello, but this custom has not prevailed
elsewhere. <i>Recitativo secco</i> is not used
so much now as it was in the earlier days of
opera, but short passages of it are found in
many modern works, even those of Wagner,
while in oratorio it is not at all infrequent.
Here is an example of it from Mozart's
"Don Giovanni":&mdash;</p>

<p>Alessandro Scarlatti was the first to make
systematic use of that richer form of recitation
known as <i>recitativo stromentato</i>. Indeed,
some historians declare, and with fairly
good ground, that he invented this species.
<i>Recitativo stromentato</i> is recitative with an
especially designed orchestral accompaniment
instead of the simple chords of the <i>secco</i>
style. Usually the most significant orchestral
passages are placed in the pauses between
the phrases uttered by the voice.
The whole recitative thus becomes more
passionate, more varied, and more filled with
meaning. The extreme development of
<i>recitativo stromentato</i> is to be found in
Wagner's later dramas, in which entire
scenes are made of it. Excellent examples
of it in its customary modern form, however,
are to be found in his earlier works.
Here is one from the first act of "Lohengrin":&mdash;</p>

<p>It will readily be perceived that these
improvements in diversification of the recitative
gave the Italian opera a livelier musical
character, and made it appeal more directly
to the popular taste. But significant as
Scarlatti's labor in this department was, its influence
did not equal that of his development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of the <i>aria da capo</i>. We have already
seen that Cavalli made a step in the direction
of this form by repeating the first part of a
tune to make its close. It was Alessandro
Scarlatti, however, who completely established
the position of the aria in opera and
defined its form. He himself was a noted
singer and a teacher of singing, and he saw
in the aria abundant opportunity for the
display of pure vocal ability. His success
in making music that enabled singers to
reveal the beauties of their voices decided
the direction in which Italian opera was to
move until almost the present day, and led
to the birth of a numerous body of composers
upon whom I am fond of placing the
title "Neapolitan school." The theory of
the <i>aria da capo</i> is a purely musical one, and
its inventors did not perceive that it was
distinctly opposed to dramatic fidelity.
The conception of a melody in three sections,
of which the first and third are the
same and the middle one strongly contrasting,
belongs to the realm of absolute music.
When the composer asks a soprano to be
mildly pathetic in the beginning of an air,
work herself into a passion in the middle,
and suddenly become mildly pathetic again
at the close, simply in order that she may
repeat the opening measures, he violates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
emotional truthfulness and is guilty of false
art. The Italian opera writers seem to
have arrived at a realization of this fact
very soon, and finding that their symmetrical
tunes pleased the public, they threw
overboard all pretence of dramatic sincerity
and wrote the tunes for their own sake,
no matter whether they fitted the spirit of
the text or not. Francesco Rossi, Antonio
Caldara, Antonio Lotti, and Giovanni Maria
Buononcini were among Alessandro Scarlatti's
immediate successors, and all of them
devoted themselves to producing operas
which consisted of strings of arias, duets,
etc., united by brief passages of recitative.</p>

<p>One important result of this practice was
that the voices and abilities of the principal
singers had to be considered in order that
the arias might be effective. The singers
were thus enabled to make such great personal
impressions upon the public that they
soon became the reigning power in opera,
and actually made laws for the composers.
This was the period of the famous male
soprano singers Farinelli, Cafarelli, Senesino,
Gizziello, and others, whose marvellous singing
was due to long processes of training,
and who were the adored and inexorable
monarchs of the musical world. The state
of Italian opera in the time of Handel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
(1685-1759) is more easily described than
imagined. I have already told how the
famous composer of "The Messiah" began
his career as an opera composer. He
wrote some forty operas, all of which have
now only an historical interest. Arias and
duets from them are frequently heard in
concert, and are excellent examples of the
manner in which composers treated text in
those days. To two lines of text one frequently
finds half a dozen pages of music,
the words apparently being employed simply
to give the singer syllables to pronounce.
It must be said for Handel that he was too
great a composer to turn out mere rubbish.
While he displayed remarkable dexterity in
writing passages of pure vocal exhibition
work for the singers, he contrived to put
a considerable quantity of very good music
into his operas. Nevertheless he was under
the control of the singer and the formulæ
of the time.</p>

<p>The laws of Italian opera in that day
prescribed six persons&mdash;three men and
three women&mdash;as the proper number of
singers. The men were always sopranos or
tenors. The use of the baritone voice was
quite unknown; sometimes a bass part was
written for one of the men, but as there are
only a few fine bass parts in any of the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
operas, and no records of the fame of any
great basses except Boschi, we must conclude
that only the male soprano and tenor had
any wide vogue. In Handel's "Teseo"
there was neither bass nor tenor; all the parts
were sopranos and contraltos. Of course
there were male characters, so it is easy to
conceive how far away from anything like
dramatic truth the whole thing must have
been. The common use of the baritone
voice, the voice of the average man, did not
begin till the latter part of the last century.
The French composers, who, as we shall see,
clung more faithfully to dramatic fidelity
than the Italians, were the first to use it
extensively. Gluck made frequent use of it,
but it remained for Mozart to discover the
full scope of its usefulness.</p>

<p>The rules made by the singers and in
force in Handel's time did not stop at the
distribution of the voices. They prescribed
also the kinds and number of arias, duets,
etc. There were five kinds of aria: <i>aria
cantabile</i>, <i>aria di portamento</i>, <i>aria di mezzo
carattere</i>, <i>aria parlante</i>, and <i>aria di bravura</i>.
<i>Aria cantabile</i> was slow and flowing and usually
pathetic in style. <i>Aria di portamento</i> was
also slow, but with stronger rhythm and wider
intervals. <i>Aria parlante</i> was declamatory.
<i>Aria di mezzo carattere</i> was an air of medium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
character, containing a fusion of styles. <i>Aria
di bravura</i> was one in which every possible
opportunity was given the singer for a display
of agility in the way of runs, trills, jumps,
<i>et cætera</i>. The rules also commanded that
every scene in an opera should end with
an aria, and that in each act every principal
singer should have one aria. No singer
could have two arias in succession, nor in
any circumstances might two arias of the
same kind stand together. The hero and
heroine had each to have one <i>aria di bravura</i>
and one duet. The opera ended with a
dance and chorus. At one time no trios,
quartets, or concerted pieces were allowed.</p>

<p>A natural result of such rules was that
opera librettos were very poor stuff generally,
and had little dramatic sense or force.
Composers often took a lot of good airs
and duets from operas which had failed, and
strung them together with new text to make
a new opera. It was an experiment of this
kind which led Gluck, as we shall see, to
doubt the possibility of producing anything
artistic according to the extant methods of
Italian opera. As Gluck's movement of
reform was undertaken in Paris, and as his
works lie rather in the line of development
of French opera than of Italian, I shall recount
the story of his battle in the narrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of the growth of the French school. It is
sufficient for the present to say that his
labors had no very serious influence on
Italian composers. They continued to write
tune for tune's sake, and their modifications
in style and form would have come about
without the intervention of Gluck.</p>

<p>Immediately after Handel the Neapolitan
school of composers was conspicuous through
its development of opera buffa, comic grand
opera. The principal writers were Logroscino,
Leo, Hasse, and Pergolesi. The last
was popular both as a serious and a comic
writer somewhat later than 1770. Later
still came forward Sacchini, Galuppi, Paisiello
and Piccini. The last named, a contemporary
of Gluck and Mozart, and Gluck's
opponent in Paris, was a most melodious
writer. He deserves special mention for
his development of the operatic finale. His
finales were long concerted pieces in which
the various voices were united in rich harmonies
so as to produce a strong effect.</p>

<h3>Italian Opera to Verdi</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Cimarosa, Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini&mdash;The last writers
of the Neapolitan school&mdash;Tune for tune's sake&mdash;Rossini's
improvements in methods of opera writing&mdash;Verdi
and his three styles&mdash;"Aïda," and "Otello,"
"Falstaff," and the new school of Italian opera.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">DOMENICO CIMAROSA (Naples,
Dec. 17, 1749&mdash;Venice, Jan. 11,
1801) wrote seventy-six operas, none of
which are heard today outside of Italy,
where recently there has been a movement
to revive some of the operas of the end of
the last century. Cimarosa's masterpiece is
"Il Matrimonia Segreto," a genuinely fine
work in the department of Italian opera
buffa. The music is distinguished for its
flow of genuine and spirited humor and its
constant melody. The ensembles are excellently
made and have served as models to
later masters.</p>

<p>The most celebrated, original, and influential
of Italian masters of the present century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
before Verdi was Gioachino Antonio
Rossini, born at Pesaro, Feb. 29, 1792.
His principal works are: "Tancred" (1813),
"Otello" (1816), "Il Barbiere di Siviglia"
(1816), "Semiramide" (1823), and "Gillaume
Tell" (1829). The last named opera
was written for Paris and it was not warmly
received. Rossini appears to have taken
its failure greatly to heart, and finding himself
independent he wrote no more for the
stage. He died in Paris, Nov. 13, 1868.
"William Tell" is usually classed by historians
among French operas, because it
was written for the French stage and was a
deliberate attempt to follow the French
style. But it was its pure Italianism that
prevented it from winning immediate success
in Paris. Nevertheless it is Rossini's
masterpiece.</p>

<p>Rossini was not a man of musical genius,
nor was he one of profound musical learning.
As soon as he had enough musical science
to write a score, he dropped study once and
for all and embarked upon his career as a
composer. He had a keen perception of
the nature of those musical means which
could be employed to produce a stage effect,
and wrote always with these in his mind.
There is no depth, no sincerity, in the music
of Rossini. It is always theatrical and full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
of imposition. Perhaps the most heartless
music ever written for an opera by a man of
real talent is that of "Semiramide." Hardly
an air in it will stand the test of comparison
with its own text, and the manner in which
a plotting priest, supposed to be a dark and
mysterious villain, goes about expressing his
desperate soul through trills and scales is
almost ridiculous. Yet "Semiramide" is
full of melody, and it contains musical effects
which were new and striking at the time of
its production. The employment of four
horns together with clarinets in the finale,
for instance, was an innovation.</p>

<p>Rossini must be credited with several improvements,
although he wrote for the
singer, and his "Semiramide" is a survival
of the style of opera produced in Handel's
day. In his "Otello" he abandoned the
old <i>recitativo secco</i> and produced an opera
with <i>recitativo stromentato</i> throughout. He
enriched the instrumentation greatly, largely
through his employment of the horns. He
was a fine horn-player himself. He introduced
the use of long crescendi and also
introduced the <i>cabaletta</i>, a quick movement
to follow a slow cantabile aria, as the
"Dolce pensiero" after "Bel raggio" in
"Semiramide," or the "Semper libera" after
"Ah, fors e lui" in Verdi's "La Traviata."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Rossini also tried to abolish the custom of
permitting singers to make their own ornamental
cadenzas, insisting that he could
write good ones and that singers must use
them. The most important of all these
improvements was the abandonment of
<i>recitativo secco</i>. While all other composers
did not at once follow his lead, the superiority
of operas containing only <i>recitativo
stromentato</i> gradually became clear, and <i>recitativo
secco</i> almost disappeared. It is written
by composers of today only in very brief
passages.</p>

<p>Rossini's "Barber of Seville" is a genuinely
good example of opera buffa. It
is full of melody and it sparkles with
vivacity. When well performed it must
always give pleasure to intelligent hearers.
"William Tell" is a melodious, fluent, and
in places really eloquent piece of dramatic
composition. It is fine enough to make one
regret that Rossini, who finished his life
under the influence of French dramatic
theories, did not again write for the stage.
The popularity of Rossini's operas in the
first three quarters of the present century
was enormous. At one time it seemed as if
all the bands and half the pianos in Europe
were playing "Di tanti regi." His works
preserved all the essential elements of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Neapolitan school founded by Alessandro
Scarlatti, of whom Rossini and his immediate
Italian successors were artistic descendants.</p>

<p>Gaetano Donizetti was born at Bergamo,
Nov. 29, 1797. His first successes were
achieved after Rossini had retired. His
most important works are: "Elisir d'Amore"
(1832), "Lucrezia Borgia" (1834), "Lucia
di Lammermoor" (1835), "La Favorita"
(1840), "Linda di Chamounix" (1842), and
"Don Pasquale" (1842). Donizetti cannot
be said to have contributed anything to
the development of Italian opera except a
simpler and less pretentious style than that
of Rossini. Weak and watery as his grand
operas appear to us now, they had a good
influence at the time of their production.
His opera buffa "Elisir d'Amore" is, when
well performed, a very pleasing trifle. Donizetti
had an excellent flow of melody, but
he sacrificed dramatic truth to musical effectiveness
at all times in his operas.</p>

<p>Vincenzo Bellini (1802-1835) wrote also
in a sweet, melodious, and generally sentimental
style, except in "Norma" (1832), in
which one of the most dramatic librettos
in the whole field of opera inspired the composer
to the production of some really admirable
music. Bellini's "Norma" went
far toward showing how a pure Italian style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and a powerful dramatic utterance might be
reconciled. His "La Sonnambula" (1831)
is occasionally performed, for the glory of
some light soprano. Bellini might have
achieved much if he had not died so
young.</p>

<p>Saverio Mercadante (1795-1870) wrote
sixty operas. His most important works
are: "Elisa e Claudio" (1822), and "Il Guiramento"
(1837). The latter work not only
contains powerful ensembles and solos, but
differs from the style of Rossini more
than any other of Mercadante's works. It
contains passages which are original, yet
remind us of the style of Meyerbeer and of
Wagner in his "Rienzi."</p>

<p>We come now to the greatest opera composer
that Italy has produced,&mdash;a composer
who ranks with the representative masters
of other schools and whose career is an epitome
of the history of Italian opera in his
time. Giuseppe Verdi was born at Roncole,
near Busseto, Oct. 9, 1813. He took his
first lessons from a local organist, but in
1833 was sent to Milan to study. His first
opera, "Oberto, Conte di San Bonifazio,"
was produced at Milan in 1839. His principal
works since have been: "Ernani"
(1844), "Rigoletto" (1851), "Il Trovatore"
(1853), "La Traviata" (1853),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
"Aïda" (1871), "Otello" (1887), and
"Falstaff" (1893).</p>

<p>Verdi's music has been divided into three
styles. It will, perhaps, be somewhat difficult
for the average listener to distinguish
more than two, yet there are musical
grounds for the statement. His earliest
operas are in the old Neapolitan style as it
had come to exist in Verdi's time. They
consist of series of tunes, strung on threads
of recitative, without any consideration of
dramatic fidelity except a vague, general
fitness of color. Their music is designed
strictly to tickle the ear. In "Ernani" we
meet with Verdi's second style, which is
characterized by immense vigor, boisterous
instrumentation, and contrasts of tremendous
dramatic power with cheap dance
music. "Rigoletto" is the best and most
familiar specimen of this period. "Il Trovatore,"
though of later date than "Rigoletto,"
is rather in the style of the first period.
The third period began with "Aïda," in
which Verdi parted company forever with
elementary rhythms and harmonies, common
dance tunes, coarse instrumentation,
and operatic claptrap in general. "Aïda"
is a grand and inspiring masterpiece in
which the Verdian stream of melody is
quite as rich as in the earlier works, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
is guided in artistic channels. The music is
intense in its dramatic passion, and by the
use of rich harmony and changeful melody
Verdi creates an atmosphere full of local
color. In "Aïda," however, Verdi preserved
all the familiar forms of the older
Italian operas. He uses even the <i>aria da
capo</i> in its modern shape. But into everything
is infused a true dramatic spirit. It is
in characterization that the greatest shortcoming
of the "Aïda" music is to be found.
Nevertheless, "Aïda" is the best opera
written by an Italian up to its date of
production.</p>

<p>In his next opera, "Otello," written at a
time when most composers would have retired
to rest on their laurels, Verdi made
another tremendous stride upward, and
stamped himself as one of the world's genuine
masters. In "Otello" he abandoned
all the old forms. There are no set instrumental
introductions to arias, not set arias,
no cabaletti. The only lyrics are Desdemona's
"Ave Maria" and "Willow" song,
which are introduced as songs might be in a
spoken drama. Verdi named "Otello" a
lyric drama, and that is precisely what it is.
The single speeches are treated as speeches,
not as songs, and the dialogue is pure dialogue,
not as duets or trios. Much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
score is in the modern style of arioso, a
species of recitative in which the phrases are
highly melodic in style without forming a
complete tune, and yet preserve their dramatic
truthfulness. The orchestration is
immensely rich and expressive, and is quite
independent of the voices. One or two
leading motives of the Wagnerian kind are
employed with much judgment and moderation.
The libretto, a remarkably fine
adaptation of the Shakespearian play, is by
Arrigo Boito (born 1842), himself the composer
of a very fine opera, "Mefistofele,"
intensely modern in style.</p>

<p>Verdi was accused of imitating Wagner
in both "Aïda" and "Otello," chiefly because
he modified and afterward abandoned
the recognized forms of the Italian school.
The charge cannot be sustained. Verdi has
never for an instant sacrificed his individuality,
and his music is as purely and intensely
Italian as Wagner's is German. The
same charge was made against Gounod when
he wrote "Romeo et Juliette," a thoroughly
French work. Verdi in these operas was
simply following the dictates of his mature
genius, which was leading him toward one of
the most significant developments of our
time. He was struggling to adapt to the
fundamental theories of opera, as expounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
by its founders, Rinuccini and Peri, the vast
and complicated materials of modern musical
expression. In "Aïda" he endeavored
to reconcile the formulæ of the Neapolitan
school with the esthetic principles of the
Greek drama and approached as closely to
complete success as the opposing nature of
the two chief elements would permit. In
"Otello" he confessed the unsuitability of
the Neapolitan forms to the full and detailed
union of text and music. He preserved the
Italian beauty of the vocal part of opera,
constructed it with a consistent, determined,
and generally successful attempt at organic
union with the text, and so produced an
opera which will, I believe, live. That he
was wholly uninfluenced by Wagner's style,
though he was attentive to Wagner's proclamations
of the true theory of dramatic
composition, is demonstrated by "Otello,"
and still more conclusively by his last work,
"Falstaff," which is as far away from Wagner's
style as is Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro,"
and yet which is built on precisely the same
dramatic principles as Wagner's "Die Meistersinger."</p>

<p>In "Falstaff" we hear the voice of Mozart.
If Mozart had lived in the latter
part of this century he might have written
this noble work. In "Falstaff" Verdi has,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
as in "Otello," declined to use any of the
Neapolitan paraphernalia. There is not a
single number that approaches the old aria
form except two small lyrics in the last
scene. There are quartets, but they are in
disguise. They are dialogues for four persons,
written with profound musical learning,
and with the unaffected freedom of the
most playful fancy. But the great bulk of
the dialogue is in the true Verdian arioso
style, that glowing recitation which is the
chief means of expression in this master's
last works. There are no Wagnerian leading
motives in the orchestration, but the
orchestra independently accompanies and
explicates the drama in a series of picturesque
phrases whose beauties and significance
will not be exhausted in many hearings.
But what will most delight and amaze every
hearer of this music is its youthful vigor. It
is as fresh and spontaneous as the work of a
young man in the blush of his first love, yet
it is full of the wisdom and experience of
him who is the epitome of more than half a
century of Italian opera. It bustles, it glows,
it inspires, yet it never transcends the modesty
of art. Rich, complex, brilliant, and
eloquent as the orchestration is, it never
strains for effects and it is never blatant.
Subtle, varied, polished as the recitation is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
it has not a measure that cannot be sung,
and neither the voice of the singer nor the
ear of the hearer is ever outraged. In short,
"Falstaff" is the work of a man whose
genius is inexhaustible, whose natural fire
burned in his eightieth year with all the
glow of that dawn when "Ernani" was the
morning star.</p>

<p>The latest development of Italian opera is
the short work as seen in the "Cavalleria
Rusticana" and "Pagliacci,&mdash;" probably a
passing fashion. It shows no evidences of
permanency, for its composers have produced
no new style. They have employed the
whole material of Verdi's later operas, and
the only new feature is the condensation,
which does not always give good musical
results, because the emotions shift too constantly
to permit a complete and influential
musical embodiment of any one state.
These young composers have tried to
advance beyond Verdi in complexity
of rhythm and boldness of modulation.
Some of their modulations are made obviously
for the sake of oddity. The <i>aria
da capo</i> has disappeared entirely from the
modern Italian opera. But the greatest
achievement of the latest writers, chiefly
Verdi, is the development, to what seems to
be the highest possible point, of the beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
arioso style of Italy,&mdash;the style which
combines most of the power of German
declamation with all the elegance and singable
quality of the Neapolitan manner.</p>

<p>Arrigo Boito, born at Padua, Feb. 24,
1842, and still living, produced one remarkable
opera, "Mefistofele," first performed on
March 5, 1868, at La Scala Theatre, Milan.
The work, in its original form, was so
subtle, so philosophical, so undramatic, so
thoroughly in sympathy with the spirit of
Goethe's "Faust," and withal such a radical
departure from everything recognized as
opera by the Italians, that it caused the
most heated controversy. In 1875 a revised
version, that now known to the public, was
put forward, and this has pleased the majority
of opera-goers. The work is episodic
and disjointed, but its characterization is
most graphic, and the dramatic force of
some of its scenes, notably that in the
prison, is enormous. "Mefistofele" shares
with "Aïda" the honor of having restored
dramatic truth to the Italian lyric stage, but
it lacks the skill in theatrical construction
shown in Verdi's work. Boito has contented
himself in later years with writing Verdi's
libretti, but Verdi himself is authority for
the statement that Boito has written an opera
called "Nerone," which is a masterpiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
The opera music of the Italian school, in
its entirety, is marked by greater floridity
than that of other schools. The superficial,
sensuous charms of the human voice have
always appealed powerfully to the Italian
race, and its composers have catered to this
taste. An honorable ambition for a fame
wider than the limits of their own country
has led Italian composers to select from
other schools their most immediately popular
elements. The present Italian opera is
eclectic. Its excellence lies largely in the
fact that it does not run to extremes in any
direction.</p>

Grand Opera&mdash;Advent of Lulli&mdash;His acquisition of

<p class="cap">THE history of French opera begins
with the performance of a curious
little pastoral in which the germs of some
parts of the lyric drama may be found.
The age of the work leads French writers
to claim precedence over Italy in the invention
of opera, but such claims are easily
overthrown by the accumulation of evidence
that the advent of Peri's "Daphne" was the
result of a systematic series of experiments
looking toward the revival of the Greek
drama. In 1577 an Italian violinist named
Baltazarini was imported from Piedmont
into France by Marshal de Brissac. Catherine
de Médicis made him her intendant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of music and <i>valet de chambre</i> to the king.
He changed his name to Balthasar de Beaujoyeux,
and is so known in musical history,
which, however, is generally silent about
him. He introduced the Italian ballet to
Paris, and also produced the first pastoral
opera there. This pastoral is entitled "Circe,"
but is better known as the "Ballet Comique
de la Royne." It was produced as the festival
play for the marriage of the Duke de
Joyeuse and Mlle. de Vaudemont. It is
purely pastoral in character and has little or
nothing of the true dramatic character of
opera, though it has some of the operatic
forms. There are choruses in four parts,
dances, and accompanied solos. The last
are written in a slow and melodious form of
recitative, which is pleasing, but not especially
expressive. Doubtless Beaujoyeux,
who left Italy about the time when the
experiments in monodic writing were beginning,
must have known something of the
nature of the movement. This he communicated
to Beaulieu and Salmon, who
wrote most, if not all, of the music of the
ballet which he arranged.</p>

<p>These French ballets, of which "Circe"
was apparently the first performed at court,
owe probably quite as much of their origin
to the old pastoral plays of the country as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
they do to the Italian monody. As far back
as the thirteenth century the troubadours
had constructed little pastorals, with solo
vocal music, and at least one of these, Adam
de la Halle's "Gieus de Robin et de Marion,"
contained well-formed songs. These
little works, performed in Picardy and Provence,
declined with the troubadours, but
some record of them may have helped the
court composers of the latter end of the 16th
century in the formation of their recitative.
The French ballet differed from the earliest
Italian opera in that most of its music was
designed as an accompaniment to action,
largely pantomimic and wholly terpsichorean
in its nature. The solo parts were short and
built on lines wholly dissociated from those
of the Florentine recitative.</p>

<p>It was not until Italian opera made its
way into France that a genuine French opera
was developed. The first attempt was made
by Rinuccini, who took "Eurydice" to Paris
in 1600. Its total failure to touch the popular
taste is an excellent demonstration of
the difference between it and the musical
shows to which the French were accustomed;
and during the entire reign of Louis XIII.
(1610-1643) the ballet remained the favorite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
form in France. An attempt was made in
the minority of Louis XIV. by Cardinal
Mazarin to revive the Italian opera, but
again it did not meet with favor. The
earliest attempt at a genuine opera in French,
so far as is known, was "Akebar, Roi de
Mogol," by the Abbé Mailly, produced in
1646.</p>

<p>Pierre Perrin, a French poet (1616-1676)
was a conspicuous figure in the establishment
of opera in France. He was a sort
of major domo in the employ of Gaston,
Duke of Orléans, and his post enabled him
to make the acquaintance of some powerful
personages. Of these the Cardinal Mazarin
took a liking to him and became his patron.
He also met the composer Robert Cambert
(1628-1677), who, after hearing a performance
of "Eurydice," acceded to Perrin's
proposition to set to music his "Pastorale,"
described as the "première comedie Française
en musique." This was performed at
Issy in 1659, and afterward at Vincennes
before the king. It was successful and
led to the production by the two men of
"Ariane," "Adonis," and other works.
On Nov. 10, 1668, Perrin obtained from
Louis XIV. a patent for the performance
of opera, and founded the Académie de
Musique, now known to all the world as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the Paris Grand Opéra. Perrin and Cambert
carried on this enterprise for thirty-two
years. Their principal work was "Pomone,"
produced on March 19, 1671. The success
of this embryonic opera was something remarkable.
It ran eight months and paid
to the poet alone 30,000 francs. The score
of "Pomone," as well as that of the "Ballet
Comique de la Royne" and other early
French works, is published by Theodore
Michaelis, in a collection of the "Chefs-d'&oelig;uvre
de l'opéra Français," with piano
arrangement and an historical introduction
by J. B. Wekerlin. The following example
of Cambert's recitative, leading to a
duet, is taken from this score:&mdash;</p>

It is not difficult to see that this recitative
shows an advance in flexibility and
directness over that of Beaujoyeux. Undoubtedly
Cambert had profited by his
study of the Italian works produced under
the auspices of the Cardinal Mazarin, but
he did not penetrate the secret of the Italian
method. The influence of the ballet
style is discernible throughout the work.
Probably Cambert would have hesitated at
a complete adoption of the Italian method,
even if he had been capable of it, for it
would hardly have been approved by the
public taste of France at that time.</p>

<p>Perrin and Cambert had associated with
themselves in the Académie the Marquis
de Sourdeac, with whom Perrin, for some
reason not on record, had a quarrel in the
course of the run of "Pomone." Perrin
resigned from the partnership, which continued
without him. But he was not content
to be idle, and in company with Henri
Sinchard, a poet, and the Sieur de Sablières,
a musician, started a rival enterprise.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the famous composer,
Giovanni Battista Lulli, usually known
by his French name, Jean Baptiste Lully,
entered upon the scene and became the
virtual founder of French opera in the grand
style. Lulli was born in 1633 near Florence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and as a boy received some musical
instruction. He was taken to Paris by the
Chevalier de Guise and placed in the service
of Mlle. de Montpensier. He became a
fine violinist and was made a member of
her band. But he was stupid enough to
write an indecent poem referring to his mistress,
and she dismissed him. In spite of
this temporary downfall he succeeded in
working his way into the orchestra of Louis
XIV., known as "Les Violons du Roi," and
in 1652 became its director. He appears
to have been an expert courtier, for he won
the favor of the king and set to music some
ballet-comedies by Molière.</p>

<p>When Perrin parted company with Cambert
and Sourdeac, the opera suffered from
his rivalry. Lulli, who had now acquired
great influence with the king, saw in the
battle of the two houses his opportunity.
He proposed to purchase the interest of
Sourdeac and Cambert in the opera patent
and they accepted his terms. He then induced
the king to remodel the patent so
as to make its provisions exclusive. The
new patent conferred upon Lulli the sole
right to the performance of opera. It prohibited
the managers of other theatres from
employing more than two singers or six
players of stringed instruments. This, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
course, made grand operas out of the question
for Lulli's rivals, and he set about producing
such large works as he alone could
present.</p>

<p>Discreditable as Lulli's conduct was in
this whole matter, it must be admitted that
he did all that he could for the elevation
of French operatic art. In this direction
he had a powerful ambition, and although
it was selfish it was not altogether narrow.
His most important operas were: "Alceste"
(1674), "Thesée" (1675), "Persée" (1682),
"Roland" (1685), "Armide" (1686), and&mdash;his
last&mdash;"Acis et Galathée" (1686).
The influence of his operas may be judged
from the fact that they held the stage till
1774. Lulli's works were inferior to those
of his Italian contemporaries in purely
musical beauty. The aria as written by
Lulli possesses far less distinctness and
symmetry of form, and he showed no such
ability as the Neapolitans did in dealing
with voices in mass. Neither in duets nor
in ensembles was he especially happy. His
choral writing is generally thin and poorly
developed, and his duets are rather dialogues.
But on the other hand Lulli far excelled the
contemporary Neapolitan composers in sincerity
of purpose and in the dramatic fidelity
of his method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
He endeavored to the limit of his ability
to fit the music to the text. In this he followed
the fundamental principles of Peri, and
established that tradition of dramatic sincerity
which has never left the French school
of opera. He increased the value of the
chorus by making it an integral part of the
drama. The Neapolitans used the chorus
merely for musical effect. Lulli gave it a
dramatic reason for existence. Its music is
always appropriate to the situation and fits
well into the general tone-picture. His
recitative is built largely after the Italian
model of his time, and it is a vast advance
over that of Beaujoyeux and Cambert.
Here is an example from "Armide":&mdash;</p>

<p>It must be understood that Lulli's recitative
was not always dramatically co
rrect.
Sometimes it is merely grandiose in style,
but it is much more animated, flexible, and
capable of expression than that of his predecessors.
Lulli was undoubtedly influenced
in his solo writing by the works of Monteverde,
which were performed in Paris under
the direction of Cavalli. Lulli is said to
have written some of the ballet music which
had to be inserted in these works to please
the Parisians. The love of ballet has never
died out in France. It was a fight over it
which killed Wagner's "Tannhäuser" in
Paris in 1861. Lulli's early training naturally
made him an eclectic, and when he set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
out to provide the Parisian public with grand
operas to its taste, he chose from French
ballet and Italian opera such features as
he believed would be popular, and upon
these as a foundation reared a new version of
the Greek drama, thoroughly Gallic in its
conception.</p>

<p>Courtier, man of the world, and self-seeker,
Lulli knew how to plan an opera,
with such musical materials as there were in
his day, so that it should present some effect
of contrast and shape. For one thing, he
fairly rid himself of everything pertaining to
the ecclesiastical style of composition. As
I have said, he wrote arias, but their indistinctness
is owing largely to the fact that
the conventional form had not yet become
fully established. It is, perhaps, in the general
plan of his operas that Lulli shows the
most important advance over his predecessors.
He was certainly far ahead of Peri, Monteverde,
Cavalli, Beaujoyeux, and Cambert in
the manner in which he distributed his scenes
so as to give variety of emotion, and in the
effective way in which he arranged the succession
of recitatives, arias, choruses, and
ballets. The plan was, indeed, designed
wholly with a view to stage effectiveness, and
thereby led away from the dramatic directness
of Peri; but on the other hand Lulli's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
music followed the development of his story
with much sincerity. The breadth and force
of the recitative in many places suggest that
the public taste to which he catered was by
no means to be despised.</p>

<p>Lulli was the founder of a school, but
among his followers there was no man of
genius, and only one of noticeable talent.
This was Marin Marais (1656-1728), who
showed a broader style than Lulli in arias,
and who made some attempts at instrumental
description in his accompaniments. But the
other members of the school were mere imitators,
and French opera became little more
than an adherence to the traditions and conventions
of Lulli. Its vitality seemed in a
fair way to desert it completely, when a new
master arose and put fresh life into it.
This master was Jean Philippe Rameau,
born at Dijon, Sept. 25, 1683, died at Paris,
Sept. 12, 1764. He showed musical gifts
when a child, and his parents gave him a
musical education. He went to Milan in
1701 to study, but was dissatisfied with
Italian music. After considerable travel he
arrived in Paris in 1717, whence he was
driven away by the rivalry of the organist,
Marchand. He went into retirement in the
provinces, and wrote his "Traité de l'Harmonie."
His theoretical works gave him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
reputation, and at the age of fifty he succeeded
in having his "Hippolyte et Aricie"
produced. The conservative followers of
Lulli and the new admirers of Rameau now
entered into a controversy which lasted till
the success of an Italian opera buffa company
in 1752 united the forces, under the
title of Anti-buffonists, in defence of French
opera. Rameau's principal works were:
"Castor et Pollux" (1737), "Zoroastre"
(1749), and "Les Surprises d'Amour"
(1759).</p>

<p>Rameau's operas show certain decided
improvements upon those of Lulli. He
was a more sincere artist, with a self-sacrificing
devotion to high ideals of which Lulli
was quite incapable. The story of Rameau's
early struggles and of his late recognition by
force of sheer merit is far different from that
of Lulli's courtier-like machinations. But
Rameau recognized the value of Lulli's art forms
and did not set out to overthrow
them. He took them up and improved
upon them by reason of his strong grasp of
dramatic truth and his larger conception of
musical organism. To put the matter in the
plainest possible terms, Rameau was a much
more truthfully dramatic composer than
Lulli, and at the same time he was a better
musician. His mastery of the science of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
harmony enabled him to build an instrumental
background for his vocal parts far
richer and more expressive than anything
within the reach of Lulli. His instrumentation
was much broader and more highly
colored than his predecessor's, and his declamation
is more musical, and hence more
fruitful in melodic beauty. Rameau's works
are full of evidence that he sought earnestly
after dramatic expression in the grand style;
and that he was not wholly able to escape
affectation is due largely to the taste of the
period in which he lived,&mdash;the period of
Racine, Voltaire, and Rousseau.</p>

<p>His music, however, abounds in strong
and varied rhythms and in a generally richer
style. Previous to his time, for instance,
the French composers accompanied the
voices with strings in five parts, and flutes
and oboes in two parts. Rameau insisted
upon giving each instrument a special part,
and he introduced the now familiar custom
of writing solo passages for the different
wood wind instruments. He also greatly
improved the character of the choral writing
in French opera. But Rameau was not
highly skilled in writing for the voice. He
recognized that fact himself when it was too
late for him to remodel his style. And he
had a foolish idea that a good composer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
could set any kind of a libretto to music.
Many of his works failed to please the
Parisians simply because their books were so
weak. But on the whole, Rameau left his
mark on the French opera. There can be
no doubt that so great a composer as Gluck
learned much from him, and he must at any
rate be credited with a faithful preservation
of those principles of the real grand opera
style which entered the French school at its
inception and which have never wholly departed
from it. It was the influence of such
works as his that prepared Paris to receive
the sincere dramatic operas of Gluck, the
next composer of importance in the line of
development of French opera.</p>

<p class="cap">IN spite of the labors of Rameau the prevailing
style of Italian opera gained a
footing in Paris, where its cheap melody and
direct appeal to the unthinking gave it a
dangerous popularity. Its unreality, its dramatic
infidelity, and above all its exaltation
of the singer above the composer, went far
toward leading the Parisians astray from the
true opera given them by Lulli and Rameau.
It required the work of a man of true
genius, guided by the sincere dramatic purposes
of the earlier composers, to restore
opera in France to its position of artistic
nobility and to fix it there. The man who
achieved this was Christopher Willibald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Gluck, who turned to Paris only when he
found that his work failed of appreciation
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Gluck was born July 2, 1714, at Weidenwang,
near the frontier of Bavaria and
Bohemia. He received his early musical
instruction in a Jesuit seminary. In 1737
or 1738 he went to Italy in the service of
Prince Melzi. In Italy he wrote and produced,
in 1741, his first opera, "Artaserse."
In five years he wrote eight operas, all of
which are utterly forgotten. They were
built on the conventional plan of the Italian
opera seria of the time. In 1745 Gluck
went to England, where two important things
occurred: he produced a wretched work
called "Piramo e Tisbe," which failed; and
he heard Handel's oratorios. His "Piramo
e Tisbe" was a <i>pasticcio</i>,&mdash;an opera made up
of tunes selected from his earlier works.
Gluck's innate genius led him to perceive
that the failure of the opera was due to its
lack of dramatic sincerity, its complete want
of organic unity. He began to understand
that the opera must be a drama expressed in
musical terms. He went to Paris, heard
Rameau's operas, and learned something
about French recitative.</p>

<p>But he was not yet ready to put his half-formed
theories to the test. He wrote several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
operas in his early style, but at length he
felt that he must break with the artificial
conventions. Raniero di Calzabigi became
his librettist, and the result of their joint
labors was "Orfeo," produced at Vienna,
Oct. 5, 1762. He followed this with several
minor works in his old style, but on Dec. 16,
1767, produced "Alceste," a complete and
unyielding embodiment of his reformatory
theories. In 1769 he produced "Paris and
Helen." After this he decided that his operatic
purposes would be better understood
in Paris than in Germany, and he set out
for the French capital. There he made an
operatic version of Racine's "Iphigénie en
Aulide," which was produced April 19, 1774.
The work aroused the greatest enthusiasm
among those who had been lamenting the
decline of French opera since Rameau.
"Orfeo" and "Alceste" were produced, and
Gluck became the favorite of the nobility and
the artistic circle.</p>

<p>The admirers of Italian opera were aroused
by the success of Gluck, and selected as the
champion who should overthrow him the
gifted Italian composer Piccini. The musical
warfare was quite as warm as the subsequent
Wagner and anti-Wagnerite controversy.
Men of letters bombarded each other with impolite
phrases in the public prints, and ladies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
of fashion pelted each other with expressions
unfit for publication at private dinners. The
supporters of Gluck awaited eagerly a new
work. On Sept. 23, 1777, he produced
"Armide." It was only a success of esteem.
On May 18, 1779, he brought out "Iphigénie
en Aulide," and all Paris bowed its head
before him. Even Piccini acknowledged his
superiority. Gluck's last work was "Echo
et Narcisse," Sept. 21, 1779. He became ill,
and, after suffering for several years, died
Nov. 15, 1787.</p>

<p>The simple fact that Gluck in beginning
his labor of reform in opera selected for the
subject of his libretto the story used by Rinuccini
and Peri in "Euridice" shows that
he embarked upon his undertaking with
a sincere desire to get at the fundamental
principles of the true <i>drama per musica</i>.
From the miserable incongruity of his own
"Piramo e Tisbe" he proceeded to the
conviction that the ultimate purpose of
opera music must be a correct and moving
embodiment of the emotions expressed by
the text. The methods which he regarded
as efficient are best enumerated by himself in
the preface to his "Alceste." He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I endeavored to reduce music to its proper
function, that of seconding poetry by enforcing
the expression of the sentiment and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
interest of the situations without interrupting
the action, or weakening it by superfluous
ornament. My idea was that the relation of
music to poetry was much the same as that
of harmonious coloring and well disposed
light and shade to an accurate drawing, which
animates the figures without altering the outlines.
I have therefore been very careful
never to interrupt a singer in the heat of a
dialogue in order to introduce a tedious ritornelle,
nor to stop him in the middle of a piece
either for the purpose of displaying the flexibility
of his voice on some favorable vowel,
or that the orchestra might give him time to
take breath before a long-sustained note.</p>

<p>"Furthermore I have not thought it right
to hurry through the second part of a song,
if the words happened to be the most important
of the whole, in order to repeat the
first part regularly four times over; or to
finish the air where the sense does not end
in order to allow the singer to exhibit his
power of varying the passage at pleasure. In
fact my object was to put an end to abuses
against which good taste and good sense have
long protested in vain.</p>

<p>"My idea was that the overture ought to
indicate the subject and prepare the spectators
for the character of the piece they are
about to see; that the instruments ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
be introduced in proportion to the degree of
interest and passion in the words; and that
it was necessary above all to avoid making
too great a disparity between the recitative
and the air of a dialogue, so as not to break
the sense of a period or awkwardly interrupt
the movement and animation of a scene. I
also thought that my chief endeavor should
be to attain a grand simplicity, and consequently
I have avoided making a parade of
difficulties at the cost of clearness. I have
set no value on novelty as such, unless it
was naturally suggested by the situation and
suited to the expression. In short, there was
no rule which I did not consider myself bound
to sacrifice for the sake of effect."</p>

<p>Gluck, of course, meant for the sake of
dramatic effect. His artistic creed, as set
forth in this preface, is singularly clear and
concentrated. Any one who examines a
Gluck opera, or goes to hear his "Orfeo,"
which is still performed, in the expectation
of finding a vast difference in the outward
shape from that employed by the Italian
opera composers of the time will be disappointed.
The ground plan of opera had not
been long enough before the world to satisfy
serious thinkers that it might beneficially be
subjected to a radical reform, a reform tending
toward a restoration of the continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
recitative of Peri. Opera had to pass through
the middle stages of development, in which
its forms were perfected and exhausted, before
men could discover that as mere forms
they were valueless for the purposes of dramatic
expression, but that the materials out
of which they were made could be utilized.
This time has but recently arrived. Gluck
was ahead of it. He was not prepared to
discern the artificial restraints put upon free
expression by the old formulas. And even
if he had done so, he could not by any possibility
have induced his public to follow him
in an overthrow of all that they regarded as
a necessary part of opera.</p>

<p>Gluck was compelled to use the aria form
in his operas, because there was no other
definite form in his day, and operatic art was
not sufficiently comprehended by the public
to admit of the introduction of a new form.
The French ballet was a necessary part of
his scheme. Even a century later the Parisians
refused to accept opera without it. But
Gluck restored to the aria its dramatic purpose.
In his hands it was no longer a mere
show piece for the singer, but a definite, carefully
designed, and generally successful embodiment
of an emotional state. The famous
"Che faro senza Euridice" in his "Orfeo"
is an admirable example of the Gluck aria at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
its best. To be sure, it sounds somewhat
placid to us, accustomed as we are to the
impassioned and highly colored musical diction
of recent composers. But to the French
of Gluck's day with their by no means incorrect
conception of the purity and dignity
of Greek art, which Gluck was trying to imitate,
the "grand simplicity" of this style must
have been highly influential. Indeed if there
is one quality above all others in the music of
Gluck's "Orfeo" which strikes the thoughtful
listener of today, it is its classicism. It
is a full and satisfying embodiment of what
we believe to have been the Greek art spirit.
One can think of Gluck's "Orfeo" as being
performed in a Greek theatre of the age of
Pericles, and the fancy does not shock the
mind.</p>

<p>As in the case of the arias, so Gluck also
endeavored to make his recitative purely expressive
rather than merely conventional.
In this his task was easier, because he was
advancing along the path already trodden by
Lulli and Rameau. He strove furthermore
to make the ballet and the chorus integral
parts of the action of the play. No finer
example of this is to be found anywhere in
his works than in the scene in Hades in
"Orfeo." The dance of the demons, tentative
in style as it seems to us today, is at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
least an honest attempt to give the dancing
a pantomimic value, and the whole action of
the chorus in this scene, with its expressive
gestures and its vigorous shouts of "No" to
the pleadings of Orpheus, is an example of
dramatic organization of the highest kind.
In this scene poetry, painting, music, and
action are as firmly and indissolubly joined
as they are in any scene in those dramas
which a century later were called "the art work
of the future." Even the instrumentation
is as carefully designed for dramatic
purposes as that of Wagner. The differences
are in the state of development of the
art, not in design. In Gluck's day orchestral
effects had not been developed as they
are now, but I am quite prepared to adopt
the words of Dr. Parry: "Mozart was the
first to show real natural gift and genuine
feeling for beautiful disposition of tone, but
Gluck anticipated modern procedure in
adapting his colors exactly to the mood of
the situation. A good deal had been attempted
already in a sort of half-hearted
and formal manner, but he was the first to
seize firmly on the right principles and to
carry out his objects with any mastery of
resources."</p>

<p>Gluck's immediate influence was confined
to French opera, and it is because of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
that I have placed him in the history of
opera in France. He seems to have had
absolutely no effect on Italian opera. Less
than thirty years after his death all Europe
was whistling or strumming "Di tanti palpiti."
On French opera, however, the influence
of Gluck was permanent. He
fastened upon it the sound traditions of
Rameau, and he pointed out the true path of
progress. That his immediate successors so
frequently mistook the means for the end,
and became merely prosy and prolix where
he was simple and chaste, or in their endeavors
to avoid this fate fell into pretentious
bombast, was due to the fact that
Gluck was unquestionably ahead of his time.
In his attempts to put his theories into practice
he himself was hampered by the incomplete
development of musical material in his
day. We find him constantly struggling for
full dramatic expression and missing it because
he had not the later composer's palette
of color at his command. His imitators,
less gifted than he and moved less by unyielding
artistic convictions than by the desire to
gain general approval, could hardly be expected
to equal him. It was not till French
opera had reached the period in which its
composers by the study of the works of German
and Italian masters had formulated an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
eclectic system of expression that it was able
to take its place in the high seat of dramatic
art. Yet one seeks in vain through the contents
of French musical drama for any works
which are so pure in their attempt at dramatic
sincerity as those of Gluck.</p>

<p>His immediate successor, and the one who
best succeeded in maintaining his traditions,
was Étienne Henri Méhul (1763-1817).
His principal works were: "Stratonice"
(1792), "Ariodant" (1799), and "Joseph"
(1807). His music is simple and dignified
in style and full of expressive force. But
his operas had to give way to the more easily
popular Italian works in all countries outside
of France. Luigi Cherubini (1760-1842)
was an Italian, but passed most of his life in
Paris when he was director of the Conservatory
of Music. His principal operas were:
"Les deux Journées" (1800) and "Faniska"
(1806). Cherubini began his career by
writing old-fashioned Italian opera, but became
a convert to the theories of Gluck.
He was a writer of no small force and originality.
Beethoven was his enthusiastic admirer,
and it is certain that, although the
antiquated style of his recitative and arioso
makes his music unpalatable now, he was
sincere in his attempt at dramatic fidelity.
Another Italian who wrote for the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
stage and tried to imitate the French
manner was Gasparo Spontini (1774-1851).
His principal operas were: "La
Vestale" (1807), "Ferdinand Cortez"
(1809), "Olympie" (1819), and "Agnes von
Hohenstaufen" (1829). The last named
opera was written for Berlin. Spontini's
style seems very dry and stilted to us
now, and it is quite certain that he had
neither the melodic gift of Méhul nor the
dramatic inspiration of Cherubini. In his attempts
at scenic display, glittering stage pictures,
and the employment of imposing effects,
he foreshadowed Meyerbeer. Daniel François
Auber (1784-1871) wrote "La Muette
de Portici," generally known by its Italian
title "Massaniello," and "Fra Diavolo"
(1830). The former work is directly in the
line of transition from Spontini to Meyerbeer.
The latter belongs rather to the
school of opéra comique. Jacques François
Halévy (1799-1862) wrote several operas,
of which only "La Juive" (1835) holds the
stage. The works of Auber and Halévy
show a decided tendency away from the
simple directness of the earlier French composers
towards a cheap and easy theatrical
effectiveness. "La Juive," however, contains
some passages of singular beauty and
genuine power.</p>

and internal emptiness&mdash;Gounod and his dramatic
power&mdash;Bizet and "Carmen"&mdash;Works and tendency
of living writers of French opera.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">THE gradual drift of French opera
away from the pure style of Gluck
led to the success of one of the most remarkable
figures in the history of music,
a composer whose works persist in pleasing
the public, while they enrage both critics
and musicians. This composer was Jacob
Meyerbeer, born of wealthy Jewish parents
at Berlin, Sept. 5, 1791. He studied music
under Lauska, Clementi, and Vogler, and
began his public career as a juvenile pianist.
His first opera was "Jephthah's Vow,"&mdash;a
failure, as were several other early works.
His successful operas were: "Robert le
Diable" (Paris, 1831), "Les Huguenots"
(Paris, 1835), "The Camp in Silesia"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
(Vienna, 1843), and afterwards remodelled
as "L'Étoile du Nord," (Paris, 1854), "Le
Prophète" (1849), "Le Pardon de Ploermel",
generally called "Dinorah" (Paris,
1859), and "L'Africaine" (Paris, 1865).
He did not live to see the production of
the last work, but died May 2, 1864. Of
these works "Robert" is now performed
infrequently, and "Dinorah" only to please
some light, colorature soprano. "L'Étoile
du Nord" is practically dead. "Les
Huguenots," "Le Prophète," and "L'Africaine"
are still popular. The most consistent
and sustained of these three is
"L'Africaine," though the greatest heights
to which Meyerbeer ever ascended are to
be found in "Les Huguenots." It is
generally conceded that the duet between
Valentine and Raoul in the fourth act is
a genuinely great piece of dramatic writing.
Even Schumann and Wagner, the severest
critics of Meyerbeer, admitted that.</p>

<p>The operas of Meyerbeer are remarkable
examples of a skill entirely devoted to the
production of <i>ad captandum</i> effects. Everything
imposing, grandiose, delusive in
splendor, or dazzling in cheap finery is to
be found in these works, which are arranged
on a grand plan. Meyerbeer's distribution
of arias, duets, ensembles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
finales is the result of a deliberate eclecticism.
He took for his purpose all that
seemed most effective in the Italian and
French schools. His finales, for instance,
are often ridiculously weak in melodic ideas,
as in that of the second act of "Les Huguenots,"
but they are always worked up
with a clever combination of action, stage
pictures, and pretentious orchestration. His
arias are deliberately designed to catch the
applause of an audience. He uses ballets,
processions, pageants, and glittering masses
of people on the stage to hide his poverty
of ideas, and, as Dr. Parry well notes, when
he has absolutely no idea at all, he distracts
your attention from that fact by a cadenza
for the clarinet. His most successful combination
of music and pageantry is in the
return of Selika to her kingdom in "L'Africaine."
His poorest is the wedding festivities
of Valentine in "Les Huguenots."
There is no heart in Meyerbeer's works.
He was capable of taking infinite pains, but
all for the sake of instantaneous effect. To
quote Dr. Parry again: "The scenes are
collections of the most elaborate artifices,
carefully contrived and eminently effective
from the baldest theatrical point of view.
But for continuity, development, real feeling,
nobility of expression, greatness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
thought, anything that may be truly honored
in the observance, there is but the
rarest trace."</p>

<p>A good deal has been said about Meyerbeer's
powers of characterization, and his
works have been compared to historical
novels. But a very little analysis will show
that the characterization in "Les Huguenots,"
for instance, is almost purely pictorial.
What impression would be left of St. Bris
without his black velvet clothes and courtly
bearing? And how prominent would Marcel
be without his costume, and his war
cry "Ein feste Burg?" Marguerite de
Valois is characterized by white satin,
diamonds, and <i>arias di bravura</i>. The truth
is that Meyerbeer's characterization is altogether
superficial. The best that can be
said of Meyerbeer is that he was amazingly
clever, and that in a few places in his works,
finding theatrical effectiveness and dramatic
sincerity not incapable of achieving in combination
his desired result, he wrote like a
master.</p>

<p>The most recent French composers have
shown a tendency to utilize the general plan
of the Meyerbeer opera, but to try to infuse
into it a genuine dramatic sincerity. They
have written fewer cadenzas and more sincerely
expressive melody. They have in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
general adhered to the traditions which have
belonged to French opera from its earliest
days, the traditions of Lulli, Rameau, and
Gluck, but they have superimposed upon
the classic outlines of the works of those
masters a more attractive sensuous beauty.
They have made concessions to the demands
of a not profound public, yet they have
persistently declined to do everything for
mere empty effect, as Meyerbeer did. They
have striven to give adequate expression to
the dramatic ideas of their librettos, and
they have aimed at organic unity in their
music; but they have demonstrated their
belief that they would achieve their purpose
with music of the kind loved by the mass of
opera-goers. In this line of practice the
most successful of all the French masters
was Charles François Gounod, born in Paris,
June 17, 1818, and died in the same city,
Oct. 18, 1893.</p>

<p>He was a student at the conservatoire,
where he won the second "prix de Rome"
in 1837 and the "grand prix" in 1839.
He studied theology for two years, and the
effect of his religious pursuits, and his study
of the works of Palestrina during a stay of
several years in Rome is manifested in some
of his compositions. He himself declared
that the most powerful musical influence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
his career was his first hearing of Mozart's
"Don Giovanni." His first opera, "Sapho"
was produced April 16, 1851. It had no
lasting success. "La Nonne Sanglante"
(Oct. 18, 1854) had eleven performances
only. These works were produced at the
Grand Opéra, but Gounod was now obliged
to try his fortunes at the Théâtre Lyrique
with "Le medécin malgré lui" (Jan. 15,
1858). Meanwhile he had begun in 1855
the work which was to make his fame.
"Faust" was completed in 1857, and produced
at the Théâtre Lyrique on March 19,
1859. The work was not remarkably successful
at first, but it grew in public favor,
till today its only rival on the operatic stage
is Wagner's "Lohengrin." On Feb. 18, 1860,
Gounod produced "Philémon et Baucis," a
delicate little opera comique. This was followed
by "La Columbe," comic opera,
(Baden, 1860), "La Reine de Saba," grand
opera (Paris, Feb. 28, 1862), and "Mireille,"
grand opera (1864). None of these had
any large measure of success. "Romeo et
Juliette" (April 27, 1867) has held the
stage, largely because of M. Jean de Reszke's
popularity as Romeo. "Polyeucte" (Oct.
7, 1878), "Cinq-Mars" (April 5, 1877), and
"Le Tribut de Zamora" (1881) are all dead
and buried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Gounod's fame and his influence as a
composer of opera will rest on "Faust"
and "Romeo et Juliette." The ground
plan of both these operas is distinctly
Meyerbeerian. The differentiating factor is
Gounod's dramatic sincerity. In every
scene of "Faust" one finds evidence of the
composer's earnest search after the correct
and convincing musical embodiment of the
emotions of his personages. There is no
attempt at establishing musical connecting-links
between the different scenes, except in
the simple expedient of causing Marguerite,
in her insanity in the last act, to recall the
music of her early acquaintance with Faust.
For the rest, Gounod has treated each scene
as a separate entity and has aimed at giving
it an adequate and finished musical setting.
His forms are very free, and the
recitative is almost wholly in the arioso
style with full orchestral accompaniment.
There is some successful characterization in
"Faust." The music of Mefistofeles is
thoroughly suitable to the personage as set
forth by the librettists. The influence of
Rameau and Gluck may be found in this
work, in its definite and consistent attempt
at dramatic fidelity. That of Meyerbeer
may be seen in the distribution of the vocal
numbers and the stage pictures, such as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Kermess scene and the return of the troops.
Compare the sextet of men in "Les
Huguenots" with the trio of men in the
duel scene of "Faust," if you desire to hear
the very echo of Meyerbeer's song. But
Gounod's honesty forbade him to write
claptrap, and he does not make many concessions
to the singers. The artistic value
of "Faust" is very high. It is one of the
purest and most beautiful lyric dramas now
on the stage. The scene in the cathedral
and the death of Valentine are not equalled
in beauty and dramatic truth by anything in
the works of any other French composer, and
have been excelled perhaps only by Mozart,
Wagner, and Verdi. "Romeo et Juliette"
shows less originality and inspiration than
"Faust," but contains scenes of genuine
beauty and dramatic power. The evidences
of Meyerbeer's influence are quite as notable
as they are in the earlier work, but in
general Gounod's style of music prevents
him from falling into mere empty display.</p>

<p>Georges Bizet, born at Paris Oct. 25,
1838, and died in the same city, June 3,
1875, wrote several operas, of which "Carmen,"
produced March 3, 1875, remains
one of the most popular works of the time.
The ground plan of this drama is formed
on essentially French lines, and in the dramatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
fidelity of its music and its general
freedom from meretricious display it stands
directly in the line of the development of
the lyric drama in France. There is some
employment of leading motives in the Wagnerian
style, but it is discreet and moderate.
The work displays great originality in its
use of Spanish rhythms and in its scheme
of harmonic color. It is a noble work, a
true music drama, and its fame is well
deserved.</p>

<p>Other French composers are still living,
and their works have not yet had that test
of time which is necessary to a correct estimate
of their value. France has no one
great representative master like Verdi whose
works epitomize the tendencies of the time.
Her living composers show in their operas
the results of various influences acting upon
the fundamental principles of Lulli and
Rameau, and for that reason a brief mention
may be accorded to the leading writers.
Camille Saint-Säens, born Oct. 9, 1835,
is perhaps the most gifted of living French
composers, but he has not earned his highest
distinction as a writer of opera. His
dramatic works are: "Le Timbre d'Argent"
(1877), "Samson et Dalila" (1877), "Étienne
Marcel" (1877), "Henri VIII." (1883),
"Proserpine" (1887), "Ascanio" (1890),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
and "Phryne" (1893). None of these
works has made a serious impression except
"Samson et Dalila," which is more effective
as an oratorio than as an opera, owing to its
lack of action. Saint-Säens' opera music is
always scholarly, dignified, and pure in style.
It belongs strictly to the French school.
His more spectacular works, such as "Henri
VIII.," show the influence of Meyerbeer in
their plan, but they make a more earnest
attempt at dramatic truth.</p>

<p>Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet, born at
Montaud, near St. Étienne, May 12, 1842,
has written several operas, of which the principal
are: "Don Cæsar de Bazan" (1872),
"Le Roi de Lahore" (1877), "Herodiade"
(1881), "Manon" (1884), "Le Cid" (1885),
"Esclarmonde" (1889), "Le Mage" (1891),
and "Werther" (1892). In his more idyllic
works, such as "Werther" and "Manon,"
he follows the lead of Gounod, while his
more pretentious operas, such as "Le Roi
de Lahore," "Esclarmonde," and "Le Cid,"
are decidedly Meyerbeerian in general plan,
though usually more refined than those of
Meyerbeer in general treatment. At the
same time, in "Esclarmonde" at least,
Massenet has sought to follow Wagner in
the use of leading motives and in the gorgeous
coloring of his orchestration. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
best works, however, are genuine lyric dramas,
distinctly French in plan and style.</p>

<p>The French composer who has tried most
earnestly to select the best features of Gounod,
Meyerbeer, and Wagner, and weld them
into a genuinely French opera, is Ernest
Reyer, born at Marseilles, Dec. 1, 1823.
His principal works are: "Sigurd" (1884)
and "Salammbô" (1890). Neither has attained
wide success, but they deserve mention
here as illustrating the devotion of the
present French composers to the high dramatic
traditions of their nation. Alfred
Bruneau, born March 1, 1857, in his "Le
Rêve" (1891) and "L'Attaque du Moulin"
(1893), has shown himself to be greatly influenced
by the works of Richard Wagner.
Indeed, the spirit of Wagner broods over
much of recent French dramatic music. It
will readily be understood that it is easier
for Frenchmen to follow Wagner than it
is for composers of almost any other nation,
because Wagner's dramatic theories are not
different in their fundamental principles from
those of Lulli, Rameau, and Gluck. The
chief difficulty encountered by the modern
French writers is the survival of a public
fondness for the popular features of the
Meyerbeer opera, and the composers in
taking account of this fondness have preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
much of a ground plan which cannot
be wholly reconciled with the Wagner theories.
But the French writers deserve respect
for their sincerity and for the infrequency
with which they compose mere show pieces
for singers. They write very favorably for
the voice, but they try to make beautiful
arias with real expressive power.</p>

<h3>German Opera to Mozart</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Schütz and his version of "Dafne"&mdash;Hamburg and its
opera&mdash;Works of Reinhard Keiser&mdash;The "Singspiel"&mdash;Mozart
and his dramatic works&mdash;"Don
Giovanni," Italian in form and German in tendency.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">THE story of the introduction of opera
into German is sufficiently amusing
to form part of an operetta plot. There was
no opera of native origin, but the fame of
the Italian product having reached the ears
of the Elector John George I., of Saxony,
he determined to have one of these new lyric
dramas performed as the festival play at the
marriage of his daughter. Heinrich Schütz,
whom we have already met as the composer
of the "Seven Last Words of Christ," was
the elector's court-director of music, and he
was accordingly commissioned to procure
from Florence a copy of "Daphne," the
pastoral of Peri and Rinuccini. The copy
having been obtained, Martin Opitz, a poet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
was ordered to translate it into German.
He did his work with poetic feeling, but
without musical knowledge, and when his
text was completed it could not be sung to
the music of Peri. Consequently Schütz
was directed to write new music, and thus
the first German opera came into existence.
It was performed on April 13, 1627. The
work has been lost and there is no account
of its reception. It is quite probable that
its music imitated the Italian monodic style,
with which Schütz had previously become
acquainted while visiting Italy. After his
second journey to Italy Schütz wrote an
opera called "Orpheus," which was produced
in Dresden, Nov. 20, 1638. This
work is also lost, but it was probably an
imitation of Monteverde's "Orfeo."</p>

<p>Meanwhile all attempts at establishing a
national German opera were overthrown by
the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War.
When that had ended, Schütz, who had
seemed likely to do something for the lyric
drama in his country, devoted himself, except
in the case of the work already mentioned,
to sacred composition. Italian opera had
made its way into Germany, where it became
the fashionable amusement of the aristocracy
of Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, and Munich. It
had no connection with the art life of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
German people, but maintained its purely
exotic condition. Only in Hamburg was
there anything that seemed to proceed from
native impulse. It was a free city; it had
grown enormously wealthy by its commerce;
and it was far away from the centre of
activity in the war.</p>

<p>Hamburg was a musical centre, and was
especially famous for its organists and composers
of sacred music. The latter were
strong advocates of that kind of individuality
of expression in sacred music which
paved the way for the Passions of Bach.
They did not feel that the intense intimacy
of Protestant faith could be embodied in
music of the Palestrina school. They introduced
a semi-dramatic recitative into their
works, and their church cantatas had a
decidedly dramatic color. A public taste
formed on such church music was ripe for
the enjoyment of opera, and the first attempt
by a native German composer, though it was
hardly anything more than an oratorio given
with scenery and action, aroused great interest.
This work was "Adam and Eve,"
composed by Johann Theile (1646-1724).
It was produced on Jan. 2, 1678.</p>

<p>It was not until 1693, however,&mdash;when
Johann Sigismund Kusser (1657-1727) went
to Hamburg and introduced his own works
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
modelled after those of Steffani, and also the
Italian method of singing,&mdash;that decided
progress was made. In 1694 Reinhard Keiser
(1673-1739) went from Leipsic to Hamburg,
where he produced one hundred and
sixteen operas, and was all his life the pet of
the public. His works were full of facile
melody and they had a sincere charm in
that they strove to express character in their
music. From 1703 to 1706 Handel wrote
for the Hamburg opera, but as his works
were strictly Italian in style he did not exert
such an influence as might have been expected
from a man of his genius. Gradually
attempts at sustaining German opera became
weaker and weaker, and in 1738 it was discontinued
in Hamburg, which now, like
other German cities gave itself up to the
Italians.</p>

<p>Leipsic and Vienna made earnest attempts
to support the German "singspiel" (song-play).
It is hard to define singspiel, because
it is exclusively German. It is a musical
drama in which there is spoken dialogue and
light music in the song style. Yet at times
the Germans themselves have seemed to
lose the distinction between singspiel and
opera. In the latter we meet with music
designed to develop the dramatic design of
the work, while in the former no such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
attempt is made. Works of the singspiel
class were produced in Leipsic and Vienna,
and they had considerable influence upon
the development of German opera. Their
construction gave composers experience in
writing for voices. Furthermore, the composers
gradually adopted the forms and
methods of opera and so gained facility in
the use of operatic material. This process
continued till the advent of the first German
genius in the field of opera and his earliest
works, though called song-plays, have been
accepted outside of Germany as operas.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)
wrote many works for the stage, of which
these were the principal: "Bastien et Bastienne,"
operetta, one act (1768), "La Finta
semplice," opera buffa (1766), "Mitridate,
Re di Ponto," opera (1770), "Lucio Silla,"
opera (1772), "Idomeneo," opera seria
(1781), "Die Entführung aus dem Serail,"
comic opera (1782), "Le Nozze di Figaro,"
opera buffa (1786), "Don Giovanni," opera
buffa (1787), and "Die Zauberflöte," opera
seria (1791). Mozart's earliest works and,
indeed, some of his later works, which I
have not mentioned, were in the strictest
Italian style. "Don Giovanni," too, is
essentially Italian, and is seldom well performed
by Germans. But in all Mozart's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
dramatic works there is a German spirit,
manifested not so much in the style of the
music, perhaps, as in the entire sincerity of
its character. Mozart made no revolution
in operatic forms, and because of that it is
by no means easy to define the improvements
which he made in the art of the
German lyric stage. Yet it is indisputable
that before Mozart there was no distinctive
school of German opera, and that since his
day there has always been one.</p>

<p>"Die Entführung aus dem Serail," often
called by its Italian title "Il Seraglio," was
Mozart's first attempt at a German work, but
the general plan and style follow the Italian
opera of the time. What Mozart achieved
was the introduction of a more definite and
sincere expressiveness in the arias. In "Le
Nozze di Figaro" Mozart's music is marvellous
in its adaptation to the comic action
of the play, and in its suitability to the characters
of the various persons. There is
absolutely nothing new in the forms or
the general plan. The outline is all Italian;
the coloring is all Mozart's. And it has
that peculiar German solidity which comes
from the tendency of the people to get to the
bottom of things. Superficiality is opposed
to the German nature. It was the fatal weakness
of Italian opera. Mozart went below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
the surface in his "Figaro." A musical
feature of this work and of "Don Giovanni,"
noted by Dr. Parry, is the way in which the
composer "often knits together a number of
movements into a continuous series, especially
at the end of the act. This was the
way in which complete assimilation of the
musical factors into a composite whole was
gradually approached." In "Die Zauberflöte"
Mozart again followed Italian forms,
but there is a profundity of thought in some
parts of the work wholly foreign to all
Italian conceptions of beauty. I am unable,
however, to find ground for preferring this
work to "Don Giovanni," as many writers
do. To my mind "Don Giovanni," is not
only the greatest of Mozart's works, but
of all works in the old form. It was
written in the prime of the classical period,
before Weber had revolutionized with "Der
Freischütz" the German conception of
opera, and before Beethoven had become
at once the culmination of the classic and
the prophet of the romantic school. It has
lived through all the changes of a century,
and today stands forth in its clear, calm
beauty, a thing of joy forever, beside the
pulsating creations of the romantic school,
even in the presence of Wagner's mighty
creations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
"Don Juan" possesses the universality
of a work of true genius. Its characters are
recognizable as types, and its human nature
belongs to no period, but to all time. It is
uncommon in ideas and unconventional in
treatment. Even Lorenzo da Ponte (born
at Ceneda, Italy, March 10, 1749, died at
New York, August 17, 1838) did something
original when he wrote the book, for
he gave us an opera without a hero. Don
Juan is anything but a hero, and one hardly
feels inclined to accept the imposing ghost
of the Commendator as one. Don Octavio
is a very estimable person, and is ever ready
with his good advice, but it is not of such
stuff as he that heroes are made; and as for
Leporello, he is the prince of cowards. Indeed,
so strong is the comedy element in
"Don Juan," so fine and faithful the character
painting, so significant the exposition
of human weakness and folly, that despite
the fatal ending of the work, it would require
no great ingenuity of argument to
establish it as one of the purest and loftiest
specimens of true comic opera.</p>

<p>The nobility of its music does not make
this classification absurd, for let us remember
that in the greatest of all comic music dramas,
"Die Meistersinger," the music
is second to none in loftiness of character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
beauty of melody, dignity of color,
and splendor of instrumental treatment.
Mozart's biographer, Jahn, recognizes the
presence of the true comedy spirit in Da
Ponte's book when he says: "He has endowed
his characters with the easy, pleasure-loving
spirit of the time; and the sensual
frivolity of life at Venice or Vienna is mirrored
in every page of his 'Don Giovanni.'"
He says further that the librettist furnished
the composer with "a number of musically
effective situations, in which the elements of
tragedy and comedy, of horror and merriment,
meet and mingle together. This
curious intermixture of ground tones, which
seldom allows expression to any one pure
and unalloyed mood, is the special characteristic
of the opera. Mozart grasped the
unity of these contrasts lying deep in human
nature and expressed them so harmoniously
as to open a new province to his art, for the
development of which its mightiest forces
were henceforward to be concentrated."</p>

<p>Tempting, however, as the comic aspect
of Mozart's opera is, we must not lose sight
of the fact that the work has a serious purpose.
Don Juan, bold and unscrupulous
as he is, fails in every attempt, and finally
meets with utter discomfiture and destruction.
There is something here of the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
of the old Greek tragedy, which always
voiced a deep moral truth. After all, there
is a term which fits "Don Juan" and
roundly describes it. One of the names
given to the lyric drama of Italy, when it
was brought forth by Jacopo Peri and his associates,
was Tragicomedia. Where is there
today a nobler specimen of Tragicomedia
than the "Don Juan" of Mozart?</p>

<p>As for the music of the opera, nothing
better has ever been said about it than what
Schink wrote in the <i>Dramaturgische Monate</i>
in 1790. He says: "How can this music,
so full of force, majesty, and grandeur, be
expected to please the lovers of ordinary
opera, who bring their ears to the theatre
with them, but leave their hearts at home?...
His music has been profoundly felt
and thought out in its relation to the characters,
situations, and sentiments of his personages.
It is a study in language, treated
musically.</p>

<p>"He never decks out his songs with unnecessary
and meaningless passages. That
is the way in which expression is banished
from music; expression consisting not in
particular words, but in the skilful and
natural combination of sounds as a medium
of real emotion. Of this method of expression
Mozart is a consummate master. Each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
sound which he produces has its origin in
emotion and overflows with it."</p>

<p>This last sentence of Schink's is charged
with import. One who studies the music
of "Don Juan" carefully must be convinced
of the truth of the critic's view. If it is
true, however, it proclaims the presence of
the essential elements of musical romanticism
in this truly classic opera. To some
extent what we call romanticism has always
been present in art music, while it was and
is the vital principle of folk tunes. It was
when Weber united to the science and culture
of musical art the folk lore and folk
melody in which were voiced the poetic
imaginations of a people that romanticism
threw aside the shackles of tradition and
became the ruling element in the tone art.</p>

<p>Mozart was not an iconoclast. He made
no new forms; he destroyed no old ones.
But proceeding on the principle subsequently
enunciated by Schumann, that "mastery
of form leads talent to ever increasing freedom,"
he absorbed all extant forms. There
is a saying that if you wish to become an
astronomer you must make mathematics
your slave. Mozart seemed to feel that if
he wished to become a composer he must
make form his slave. As a mere child he
made himself a consummate contrapuntal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
scholar. In a word, he became literally a
master of form.</p>

<p>When, therefore, he came to the composition
of his wonderful operas, he saw no
necessity for the creation of new forms, because
he did not feel the shackles of the
old ones. To him they were chains of
roses, and the impulse had not come which
set all composers thundering against the restrictive
barriers of mere formalism. With
Mozart there was no such thing as mere
formalism; and if there is any lesson which
every repetition of "Don Juan" forces home
upon us with vital force, it is that fashion
is no restraint on genius. Mozart accepted
the material of Italian opera as he found it.
But he filled the old forms with a new spirit.
In the process of the years the spirit waxed
too mighty for the old body and took
its flight into the infinite regions of free,
untrammelled expression. Mozart stood
upon the boundary of the promised land;
Beethoven and Weber strode boldly across
the border; Wagner feasted upon the milk
and the honey.</p>

<h3>Weber and Beethoven</h3>

drama&mdash;Beethoven and his "Fidelio"&mdash;Advancement

<p class="cap">MOZART, in "Die Zauberflöte," had
touched upon an element which always
appeals to the peculiar naïveté of the
German character. That element is the
supernatural. The Germans love a good
fairy tale, and the "Nibelungen Lied," their
national epic, is a version of the most imposing
fairy tale the world knows. It was
Mozart's misfortune, however, that he clung
to old traditions and served up his German
food in Italian dressing. So it was reserved
for Weber to join hands with Beethoven
and Schubert in starting the romantic movement.
What Beethoven did for absolute
music and Schubert for the song, Weber
did for German opera. The influence which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
acted as an incentive to the romantic movement
in music was the romantic movement
in German literature. The writings
of Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Ruckert, and
others were intensely romantic in feeling
and distinctively German in character; and
they seem to have suggested to Weber the
importance of national stories as material
for opera librettos. At any rate he took
up such material with a full knowledge of
the awakened German taste for native legend
and story. Unfortunately he was easily
turned aside from this path, and induced
afterward to waste his powers upon librettos
of no value whatever.</p>

<p>Carl Maria von Weber (Dec. 18, 1786&mdash;June
5, 1826) wrote in his early days several
operas of no great importance. The
first, written when he was twelve years old,
was called "The Power of Love and Wine."
He must have known a great deal about it
at that age. He wrote also "The Forest
Maiden" and "Peter Schmoll." In 1811
was produced his "Abou Hassan," a comic
opera of considerable merit. His masterpiece
"Der Freischütz" was produced in
Berlin, June 18, 1821. His other important
stage works are: "Euryanthe," Vienna,
Oct. 25, 1823, and "Oberon," London,
April 12, 1826.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
The story of "Der Freischütz" has existed
in German literature as far back as the 17th
century, and its incidents are of the kind
that appeal most forcibly to the mass of the
German people. It presents the conflict
of the powers of good and evil in a concrete
form, the evil being represented by Samiel,
a German Mephistopheles, and the good
by the pious Agatha. The superstitious yet
religious minds of the average Germans
were deeply affected by the manner in which
Weber set this struggle to music. His melodies
are notable in that they are quite
within the grasp of popular comprehension,
yet embody both religious sentiment and
individual character. One of the salient
peculiarities of "Der Freischütz" is its employment
of the simple song form, so dear
to the Germans in their folk-tunes. Weber's
use of this form went far toward assisting the
general public to an appreciation of his work.
The old German singspiel form is preserved
in the original score of "Der Freischütz,"
which contains spoken dialogue.
The recitatives usually employed now were
written by Hector Berlioz for the Parisian
production of the work.</p>

<p>The significance of Weber's position in
German opera must be found in the fact
that in his theory of the musical drama he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
anticipated Wagner and paved the way for
him. He defined opera as "an art work
complete in itself, in which all the parts and
contributions of the related and utilized arts
meet and disappear in each other, and, in
a manner, form a new world by their own
destruction." He believed that a libretto
should not be constructed with a view to
its offering pegs upon which to hang strings
of pretty music, but that there should be
an organic union of the various arts employed
in dramatic representation. His
theory as to the purpose of lyric music was
fully set forth in these words: "It is the
first and most sacred duty of song to be
truthful with the utmost fidelity possible
in declamation." He furthermore had no
sympathy with the rigid and restrictive formalism
of the old-fashioned Italian opera,
but was a thorough believer in the fundamental
principle of romantic music, that the
content must govern and prescribe the form:
"All striving for the beautiful and the new
good is praiseworthy, but the creation of
a new form must be generated by the poem
which is sitting." Mr. H. E. Krehbiel
says in "Famous Composers and their
Works," "Here we find stated in the plainest
and most succinct terms the foundation
principles of the modern lyric drama."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
These principles rest on the essential laws
laid down originally by Peri, followed by
Lulli and Rameau, and regenerated by
Gluck. It was in following these principles
and at the same time recognizing the
characteristics of the German people and
embodying them in his music that Weber
formulated a style which has been a model
and an inspiration to all the sincere composers
of opera since his day. Wagner's
debt to him was freely acknowledged, while
Berlioz never wearied in expressing his admiration
for the genius of Weber. To
quote Mr. Krehbiel's masterly article once
more: "To the band he gave a share in the
representation such as only Beethoven, Mozart,
and Gluck before him had dreamed of.
The most striking feature of his treatment
of the orchestra is his emancipation of the
wood wind choir. His numerous discoveries
in the domain of effects consequent on
his profound study of instrumental <i>timbre</i>
placed colors upon the palettes of every
one of his successors. The supernatural
voices of his Wolf's Glen are echoed in
Verdi as well as in Meyerbeer and Marschner.
The fairy footsteps of Oberon's
dainty folk are heard not only in Mendelssohn
but in all the compositions since his
time in which the amiable creatures of super-naturalism
are sought to be delineated."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Beethoven's one opera, "Fidelio" (produced
Nov. 20, 1805), belongs to the German
romantic school, but it cannot be said
to have exerted any marked influence upon
the general advancement of that school except
in the treatment of the overture and in
the employment of the characteristic expression
of the various orchestral instruments in
the development of the story. In both of
these movements Beethoven joined hands
with Weber, whose overtures were the first
written by any German, except Beethoven,
with a deliberate purpose to embody in an
instrumental prelude the principal emotions
and incidents of the drama. Beethoven
wrote four overtures to "Fidelio," but their
numbers do not correspond to their order.
That known as "Leonora No. 1" was written
for Prague in 1807 (a performance which
did not take place). That called "Leonora
No. 2" was played at the original production
of the opera. The famous "Leonora
No. 3" is a reconstruction of No. 2, and was
prepared for the revival of "Fidelio" in
1806. The fourth, known as the "Fidelio"
overture, was written in 1814. The "Leonora
No. 3" is the finest possible preface to
an opera. In writing a dramatic work
Beethoven felt hampered by the conventionalities
of the stage. As Richard Wagner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
admirably said: "While in the oratorio and
especially in the symphony a noble, perfect
form lay before the German master, the
opera offered him an incoherent medley of
small undeveloped forms, to which was attached
a conventionalism incomprehensible
to him and restrictive of all freedom of development.
If we compare the broadly and
richly developed forms of a Beethoven symphony
with the different pieces in his
'Fidelio,' we at once perceive how the master
here felt himself restrained and hindered,
and could hardly ever attain to the proper
unfolding of his power. For this reason, as
if to launch forth at least for once in his
entire fulness, he threw himself as it were
with all the weight of desperation into the
overture, projecting in it a composition of
previously unknown breadth and significance."
It must be added that, while Beethoven
retained spoken dialogue in his opera
after the "singspiel" fashion, he infused
into his principal numbers a deeper and
more powerful dramatic expression than any
previous composer. In all opera there is
nothing more eloquent than the scene in the
prison, in which the attempted murder of
Florestan by Pizzaro is first checked by
Leonora, and afterward by the arrival of the
minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Heinrich Marschner (1796-1861) in his
"Hans Heiling" showed that he was
strongly influenced by Weber. The music
is notable for its flow of melody and its
highly wrought orchestration. The work is
founded on a story containing elements of
the supernatural similar to those in "Der
Freischütz." Marschner wrote also "Templar
and Jewess," founded on "Ivanhoe,"
and "The Vampire," a work of the gloomiest
character.</p>

<p>More recent German opera has been in a
state of confusion, owing to the enormous
influence of Richard Wagner. The immense
success of this master's embodiment
of his own theories of the lyric drama has
led to a general abolition of the set forms of
the Italian school and equally to an abandonment
of such attempts as those of Weber to
employ the song form. That German opera
has gained in richness and dramatic power
by the disuse of formality and the employment
of all the resources of the modern
declamatory arioso and orchestration cannot
be denied. But only one or two composers
have shown sufficient individuality to prevent
them from being buried under their
own imitations of the Wagnerian style.
Peter Cornelius (1824-1874), an earnest
advocate of the Wagner ideas, wrote "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Barber of Bagdad," "The Cid," and "Gunlod."
Of these the first is one of the most
successful works of the school known as the
new romanticists. The score is full of the
most characteristic and fluent melody, admirably
written and distributed among the
various voices and instruments. The themes
are rich in meaning and charged with individuality.
The musical characterization is
faithful and the musical humor simply delicious.
Carl Goldmark (1830- ), in his
"Queen of Sheba" and "Merlin," made an
attempt to superimpose the modern German
style upon a ground plan somewhat Meyerbeerian.
The music is full of sensuous richness
and at times rises to heights of genuine
passion, while every opportunity to introduce
spectacular features, such as processions and
ballets, is seized.</p>

<p>But it cannot fairly be said that any
German has done anything toward the development
of opera since Weber except
Wagner, and he has influenced operatic composers
the world over. It is to him and his
theories that I now invite the attention of
the reader.</p>

<p class="cap">RICHARD WAGNER (born at Leipsic,
May 22, 1813, died at Venice,
Feb. 13, 1883) was one of the great geniuses
of music and the mightiest master of musical
drama that ever lived. For many years
his works were the subject of bitter differences
of opinion. Persons educated to love
the old Italian operas of the Neapolitan
school, which were simply entertaining,
rebelled against Wagner's demand that the
lyric drama be taken as the most serious of
art works. Yet, as I shall show, he was
simply embodying in modern music the
principles of Peri, Lulli, Rameau, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
Gluck. He was accused of being an iconoclast,
a destroyer of all the laws laid down
by Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, yet he
was their most enthusiastic admirer and
understood them as few other musicians
have done. France, England, and Italy
long refused to receive his works, though
they were successful in America from the
outset. But his principles carried the day,
and now Paris vies with London in its admiration
of his works, and they have even
been applauded in Italy. His first grand
opera, "Rienzi," produced in 1842, was an
attempt to combine the styles of Meyerbeer
and some others in a work built on the
old Meyerbeerian plan. It was fairly well
received and remains today a good work
of its school. But it is not in the characteristic
style of Wagner. The works which
have made him famous are: "The Flying
Dutchman" (1843), "Tannhäuser" (1845),
"Lohengrin" (1850), "Tristan und Isolde"
(1865), "Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg"
(1868), "Der Ring des Nibelungen"&mdash;a
"tetralogy" consisting of four operas, "Das
Rheingold," "Die Walküre," "Siegfried,"
and "Die Götterdämmerung"&mdash;(1876),
and "Parsifal" (1882).</p>

<p>A great deal that is confusing has been
written about the Wagner system. Indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Wagner's works have been explained so
much that some persons have become convinced
that they are quite beyond comprehension.
Those who have attentively read
the present volume should have no difficulty
in understanding the brief account of the
Wagner system now to be given, because
that system is simply a new application of
the original principles of Peri. Three
salient resemblances to the Peri scheme of
opera are to be found in the Wagner plan:
first, the attempt to produce an art-form
which should resemble the Greek drama;
second, the employment of mythical or
legendary stories as subjects for librettos;
and third the construction of a form of
recitative for the dramatic declamation of
the text.</p>

<p>Wagner was utterly dissatisfied with the
condition of the lyric drama in his day.
The opera bore no relation whatever to the
national life or thought of the people. It
was a mere show designed to catch the
applause of the unthinking, to dazzle the
ignorant by empty display. In its popular
Italian form the music had no genuine
connection with the text, for the words were
mere pegs on which to hang pretty tunes.
These tunes, too, were designed, not to
convey to the hearer the emotion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
scene, but to give the singers opportunities
to display their powers. The stories of the
operas were unpoetic, undramatic, false to
truth, incoherent, and not typical. The
characters were small and unrepresentative.
The opera could not touch the heart of
the people because it did not spring from
the thought of the people. In Greece the
drama, founded as it was on the great mythological
legends of the nation, was almost
a form of religion; and its influence on the
life and thought of the people was tremendous.
Wagner's high aim was to produce
a species of German opera that should have
the same relation to the Germans as the
Greek drama had to the Greeks. It is only
by bearing in mind this fact that one can
account for such works as "Lohengrin,"
"Tannhäuser," and "Parsifal," on the one
hand, and "Der Ring des Nibelungen" on
the other. The first three are Wagner's
embodiment of the Christian mythology of
Germany, with its whole content of the
fundamental religious beliefs of the nation.
"Der Ring des Nibelungen" is his presentation
of the old pagan mythology of his
country, with its noblest thoughts pushed
to the front and its final retirement before
a new order of faith strongly suggested by
the last scene of "Die Götterdämmerung."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
The employment of the myth or legend
as a subject for dramatic treatment recommended
itself to Wagner also on a purely
musical ground, which Peri could not discover
in the crude condition of musical art in his
day. Myths are embodiments of human
types, of fundamental traits of character and
of elementary emotions. They have the
advantage of universality. They are free
from conventions of time and place. Thus
Wagner saw that the employment of mythical
subjects would permit him to concentrate the
whole power of his musical expression upon
character and emotion, which are just the
things within the scope of operatic music.
Every one of his music dramas makes action
and the pictorial elements of the drama subordinate
and accessory to the expression of the
emotions of the scene. In working out this
plan he came upon the final and fundamental
law of his theory, namely, that there must
be in a music drama an organic union of all
the arts necessary to the expression of the
emotions of the scene to the spectator. Text,
music, action, and scenery must all unite in
a common purpose, and their union must be
so complete that no one element can be
taken away without injury to the whole.
From this law Wagner derived the corollary
that he must write his own text, and so he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
did. All his librettos are his own, and they
are not mere schemes of dialogue, arias,
processions, and ballets, but remarkably fine
dramatic poems. The text being written,
according to Wagner all the other elements
in the drama, music, action and scenery,
must be devoted to the fullest and most convincing
expression of the emotions contained
in that text. Now the conveyance of emotion
is within the power of music, and the more
completely the music can be devoted to this,
the more successful it is likely to be. The
use of the myth enabled Wagner to make
perfect his organic union of the arts tributary
to the drama, because it focused the music
upon the emotions, and so carried the other
elements to the same point. This principle&mdash;concentrating
the musical expression upon
the emotion&mdash;led Wagner to adopt a new
musical form. He writes what has been
called "continuous melody." That is, there
are no set arias, duets, or ensembles in his
later works, but all the dialogue is carried on
in a free arioso form, and duets are simply
the musical conversation of two people.
Wagner wrote voluminously in regard to his
theories, and on this point he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The plastic unity and simplicity of the
mythical subjects allowed of the concentration
of the action on certain important and decisive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
points, and thus enabled me to rest on fewer
scenes, with a perseverance sufficient to expound
the motive to its ultimate dramatic
consequences. The nature of the subject,
therefore, could not induce me, in sketching
my scenes, to consider in advance their adaptability
to any particular musical form,&mdash;the
kind of treatment being in each case necessitated
by the scenes themselves. It could,
therefore, not enter my mind to engraft on
this, my musical form, growing as it did out
of the nature of the scenes, the traditional
forms of operatic music, which could not but
have marred and interrupted its organic development.
I therefore never thought of
contemplating on principle, and as a deliberate
reformer, the destruction of the aria,
duet, and other operatic forms; but the
dropping of those forms followed consistently
from the nature of my subject."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he could not proceed without
any form, because music without form would
be without design, and hence would not be an
art. Form in music is based on the systematic
repetition of fundamental melodic ideas. This
constitutes the identity of the composition.
A tune made of disjointed fragments, no two
alike, is not a tune at all. A composition
does not exist unless there is repetition of the
melodic subjects of it. In the old aria form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
these repetitions existed within each aria,
which formed in itself a separate composition.
Wagner, having abandoned the aria form,
was obliged to invent a new system of repetitions
for his continuous melody. This he
achieved by introducing the <i>leit motiv</i>, "leading
motive" or "typical theme," a melodic
phrase employed to designate a certain personality
or thought in the drama, and heard,
either in a voice part or in the orchestra,
whenever that personality or thought is
mentioned or has an immediate connection
with the scene before the auditor. It was
while composing "The Flying Dutchman"
that Wagner invented his new system. In
Senta's ballad, which tells the legend, he
employed two themes. The first of these</p>

<p class="center small smcap">[Theme One--Soprano.]</p>

<p>he intended to represent the Hollander, and

<p class="center small smcap">[Theme Two--Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass.]</p>

<p>is intended to represent the complement to
the former, the sacrificial love of Senta, which
is to bring the peace. Wagner says: "I
had merely to develop, according to their
respective tendencies, the various thematic
germs comprised in the ballad to have, as a
matter of course, the principal mental moods
in definite thematic shapes before me. When
a mental mood returned, its thematic expression
also, as a matter of course, was repeated,
since it would have been arbitrary and capricious
to have sought another motive, so long
as the object was an intelligible representation
of the subject, and not a conglomeration
of operatic pieces."</p>

<p>The <i>leit motiv</i> system was not so extensively
used by Wagner in his earlier works
as in his later ones, when the system had
become fully developed and he had obtained
a complete mastery of its difficult musical
technic. In his later works the orchestral
score is largely made up of repetitions and
elaborations of the various leading motives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
and this has led to some grave misconceptions
as to the nature and purpose of his
system. Many writers have published handbooks
purporting to explain the Wagner
dramas. These handbooks contain musical
reprints of the various thematic phrases,
with names which Wagner never thought of
giving them. The books simply follow the
scores through, page by page, enumerating
the various motives as they appear. The
result of reading these books is naturally a
belief that the principal business of the auditor's
mind at the performance of a Wagner
drama is to identify each leading motive
which is heard, and by doing so to get at the
composer's meaning. In other words, those
handbooks cause many persons to suppose
that the hearer of a Wagner score has to
translate the music into definite terms, those
terms being labels which will tell him what
the music itself does not. This is an utter
misconception of the Wagner system, and it
has been one of the chief obstacles in the
way of its ready acceptance by persons educated
in music of the older sort.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to know the name of a
single leading motive in any Wagner drama in
order to understand the work. Wagner himself
did not know all the names found in the
handbooks. He did not invent the names.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
The quotation given above explains what
Wagner was trying to accomplish by the use
of leading motives. He tried to embody
the "principal mental moods" of his dramas
in "definite thematic shapes," and to use
those thematic shapes whenever he desired
to express those moods. Now if the themes
do not express the moods, all the names in
the handbooks are worthless, because incorrect.
If the themes do express the moods,
the names are still worthless, because superfluous.
Furthermore, if a passage made up
of various leading motives does not fairly convey
to the auditor the moods and emotions
of the text and action to which that passage
is set, the whole system is a failure. If it
does convey those moods and emotions,
then it makes no difference whatever to the
auditor whether he knows the names of the
leading motives or not. It does not even
matter whether he knows that there are any
leading motives at all. An acquaintance
with the leading motives immensely increases
one's intellectual pleasure in listening to
Wagner's dramas and enables one better to
appreciate their musical form and their subtler
details; but I repeat that it is absolutely
inessential to an understanding of the dramatic
force, eloquence, and truthfulness of
the music. The text is the only test to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
applied to any opera music. If the music
expresses fairly the emotions contained in
the text, it is good dramatic music. That
was the test which Wagner himself imposed
upon opera music, and it is the test by which
his work must be judged. Every leading
motive in Wagner's dramas is explained by
text, usually on its first appearance, but
sometimes not till afterward. What is
called the sword motive makes its first appearance
in the score of "Das Rheingold,"
when Wotan simply conceives the idea of
creating a race of heroes.</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music374.mid">Listen: "Das Rheingold"</a></div>

<div class="caption"><a href="images/music374x.png">View Larger Image Here.</a></div>
</div>

<p class="center small smcap">["Das Rheingold".]</p>

<p>The meaning of this motive is thoroughly
explained when Siegmund in "Die Walküre"
sees the sword in the tree in Hunding's
house, and the trumpet in the orchestra
intones the phrase in a manner not to be mistaken.
None of the motives in these Wagnerian
dramas are composed arbitrarily. The
poet-musician used every resource of music&mdash;melody,
harmony, rhythm, and instrumental
color&mdash;to make them, in the fullest sense
of the word, expressive. Occasionally he
fell into the error of trying to embody in
music purely intellectual processes, which
are quite beyond the scope of musical expression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
But no one need ever be at a loss
as to his meaning, because the organic union
between text and music is so perfect that one
always explains the other. For example, in
the final scene of "Die Walküre" Brünnhilde
announces to Sieglinde that she will
become the mother of a great hero, Siegfried,
in this passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center listen"><a href="music/music375a.mid">Listen: "Die Walküre" Brünnhilde</a></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>And we forthwith learn to associate that
music with Siegfried in his character of hero.
Sieglinde answers Brünnhilde thus:</p>

<p>When Brünnhilde, having prophesied the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
last scene of "Die Götterdämmerung," upon
Siegfried's funeral pyre, the orchestra peals
out this phrase in majestic tones. There is
no mistaking its meaning; it proclaims the
divinity of Brünnhilde. Wagner has also
employed the sound musical device of
thematic development when it can be used
with plain meaning, and this is a decidedly
unique feature of his scheme. In "Siegfried"
the young hero plays on his hunting-horn
this theme, which seems to be an
utterance of his buoyant youth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small smcap">["Siegfried".]</p>

<p>In "Die Götterdämmerung," when Siegfried
has gained his maturity, Wagner presents
his theme rhythmically developed from
the gayety of six-eighth measure to the
solid strength of four-fourth measure and
adds to its breadth and dignity by the instrumental
treatment.</p>

<p>As I said before, if it were necessary to
go to the handbooks to find out the existence
and meaning of these musical devices, they
would be valueless. But Wagner's works
are self-explanatory. An attentive listener,
whose mind is open and who has not entered
the opera house with a preconceived idea
that an opera must always consist of pretty
arias, duets, and ensembles, interspersed with
recitatives, will have no trouble in entering
fully into the spirit of these masterpieces of
dramatic music. One of the features of
Wagner's system which will require some
attention on the part of the listener is the
complete independence of the orchestral
part. Wagner seldom writes an accompaniment
pure and simple. His orchestral
score, made up of the constant weaving and
interweaving of thematic fragments, designed
to express definite thoughts, is a vast and
complex tonal illustration of the text. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
orchestra is one of the chief agencies in the
development of the plot. Characterization
and emotional expression are largely, at
times chiefly, confided to it, and it is quite
as important a personage in the drama as
the tenor or the soprano. While it is voicing
the thoughts and emotions of the scene
in imposing tone-language the actors are
reciting the text in voice parts wholly independent.
These voice parts are frequently
written in a kind of recitative, but it is a recitative
which is better described as declamation,
because its form is so flexible. At one
instant it may be recitative pure and simple,
and the next moment it will glide into melodious
arioso. The following example is
taken from the first act of "Siegfried":&mdash;</p>

<p>The address of Mime to the Wanderer is
an admirable specimen of the Wagnerian
declamation. The phrase in the accompaniment
marked A has previously been made
known as illustrative of Mime's labor as a
smith, and it is here followed by B, a motive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
which has been identified in the score with
Mime's meditation. The two phrases used
here plainly say, "Mime is thinking," and
the text and action show us that he is thinking
very hard about the question which he
is to ask the Wanderer, for he has wagered
his head that this Wanderer cannot correctly
answer three questions. He has answered
two and this is the third. The Wanderer is
Wotan, father of the gods, in disguise, and
when he is asked who live in the sky, he
rises to his feet and, while his face glows
with celestial light, he answers in a passage
of broad and noble arioso. The orchestra,
at the point marked "dolcissimo," begins to
accompany him with the Walhalla motive,
whose meaning has been clearly brought
out in the finale of "Das Rheingold." It
makes no difference at all whether you
know the names of these motives. Their
significance has already been shown on their
first appearance in the score. And even if
it had not, they form an accompaniment
thoroughly suited to the meaning of the text
to which they are allied.</p>

<p>I have devoted this chapter to an explanation
of the Wagner system, because it
is the vital element in this master's work.
In it are to be found the novelties in his
method of applying the principles of Peri,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Gluck, and Weber. If the reader will refer
to the Gluck preface previously quoted and
to the excerpts from Weber's letters, he
will perceive how in this system Wagner
was only carrying out their ideas in a musical
form invented by himself. This new
method of Wagner's has been imitated with
disastrous results by some composers to
whose works it was unsuited, and to whose
genius it was foreign. Wiser modern
writers, like Massenet and Verdi, have
adopted the broader features of it&mdash;the continuous
melody, the arioso declamation, and
the independence and illustrative agency of
the orchestra&mdash;without attempting to make
extensive use of leading motives. Massenet
has used them moderately, Verdi not at all.
But in "Falstaff" Verdi has filled his
orchestration with illustrative melodic fragments,
which are not repeated. All recent
composers have treated the orchestral parts of
their operas with much freedom, and have
scored them with great instrumental richness.
This advance in operatic writing is
due chiefly to Wagner. It is quite impossible
to estimate at a time so soon after the
composer's death how deep and permanent
will be his influence upon operatic art, but
it is plain that every writer of today has
yielded some allegiance to him, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
one has striven to attain dramatic fidelity.
Better librettos are written for operas; and
public taste, in almost every country where
opera is given, demands that the lyric stage
shall present for consideration a genuine
<i>drama per musica</i>. This demand for sincerity
has spread into other branches of
musical art, and it can fairly be said that
Wagner has done more for the general
advancement of musical taste in his day and
immediately after it than any other composer
who ever lived.</p>

<h3>The Lessons of Musical History</h3>

<blockquote><div class="subhead">Characteristics of the three great periods: Polyphonic, Classic
and Romantic&mdash;Purposes of composers and possibilities
of music in each&mdash;Limitations of the periods and
their reasons&mdash;The contest between Classicism and
Romanticism.</div></blockquote>

<p class="cap">NO critical review of the development of
the tone art is complete without notice
of the intellectual and emotional impulses
which governed that development, and of
the characteristics of the three grand periods
into which the history of music is divided.
Two primary impulses have operated in the
formulation of a system of musical art.
These impulses are called Classicism and
Romanticism. The terms are very glibly
used by many music lovers, but are not
definitely understood by all. The ordinary
concert-goer, whose terminology is nothing
if not vague and unprecise, calls all artistic
music, above the level of that heard in
operettas or ballrooms, "classic." The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
term should be strictly applied to those
works which have stood the test of time and
have by the general consent of enlightened
music lovers been accepted as masterpieces.
From the fact, however, that the great masterpieces
of the classic composers were conspicuous
for their development of a clear,
symmetrical, and logical form, the term
"classical" in music has come to be applied
to all works in which pure beauty of form
and matter are the most conspicuous features.
"Romantic" is applied to music
in which the form is made for the immediate
purpose of a particular work, and is
the direct outgrowth of the thought contained
in that work. As Dr. Parry has
worded it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Classical' is used of works which have
held their place in general estimation for a
considerable time, and of new works which
are generally considered to be of the same
type and style. Hence the name has come
to be especially applied to works in the
forms which were adopted by the great
masters of the latter part of the last century,
as the instrumental works in the sonata form
and operas constructed after the received
traditions; and in this sense the term was
used as the opposite to 'romantic' in the
controversy between the musicians who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
wished to retain absolutely the old forms
and those, like Schumann, who wished
music to be developed in forms which should
be more the free inspiration of the composer
and less restricted in their systematic
development."</p>

<p>The controversy is now at an end, and it
is generally conceded that a modern composer
may fully choose whether he will
embody his romantic thought in the classic
sonata form, as Brahms did, or make new
forms to suit his purpose, after the manner
of Liszt and Tschaikowsky. The contest between
classicism and romanticism began as
soon as musical science had formulated
sufficient law to enable composers to work
according to some system. The very development
of the classical era itself was due
to the impulses of romanticism. But the
process of perfecting form is a purely intellectual
operation. Hence the dominance of
formal development was due to a belief that
form was of paramount importance in music,
and to a determination to work according to
that belief. The dominance of romanticism,
or free emotional impulse, could only come
when composers had arrived at the intellectual
conviction that this impulse ought to be
permitted to make its own forms according
to its needs. At this point I must ask the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
reader to accept a somewhat long quotation
from another book of my own ("What is
Good Music?"), simply because I cannot
present in any different form what I have
already said and now desire to say again:</p>

<p>"Music was originally a free dictation
of fancy or feeling, and it dates back to
the night of time. When I say 'free,'
I mean in respect to form. It was probably
a kind of intonation employed in the
solemn speech of ceremonials, as instanced
in the First Book of Samuel, x. 5: 'After
that thou shalt come to the hill of God,
where is a garrison of the Philistines; and
it shall come to pass, when thou art come
thither to the city, thou shalt meet a company
of the prophets coming down from a
high place with a psaltery and a tabret and
a pipe and a harp before them; and they
shall prophesy.' Further historical support
of the probability that song began in
mere inflections of the voice is found in
the old Neume notation, which preceded
the notation now in use. The Neumes
were marks, somewhat like the Greek accents,
placed over the vowels of a text, to indicate
the intervals, up or down, through
which the voice should pass in intoning.
What we now recognize as melody was
developed by gradual growth from intonations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
of this kind. Rhythm must have
made its appearance in music as soon as it
did in the verses to which music was set.
Eugene Veron, in his 'Æsthetics,' says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">'A very important characteristic of ancient languages
was rhythm. The more or less regular
recurrence of intonations and of similar cadences
constitutes for children and savages the most
agreeable form of music. The more the rhythm
is accentuated the better they are pleased; they
love not only its sound, but its movement also....
The most civilized nations cannot escape this
tyranny of rhythm.... Rhythm seems, indeed,
to contain some general law, possessing power
over almost all living things. One might say that
rhythm is the dance of sound, as dancing is the
rhythm of movement. The farther we go back
into the past, the more marked and dominant is it
found in language. It is certain that at one period
of the development of humanity rhythm constituted
the only music known, and it was even intertwined
with language itself.'</p>

<p>"The earliest music, then, must have been
a kind of intonation, in which the rhythm
was simply that of the text, and the melody
a derivative of the inflections of the voice,
as dictated by the natural utterance of that
text. The most artificial attempts in music
have been based on the idea that we could
return to that primitive form. One attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
was that of the founders of the church
chant; the other was that of the inventors
of opera. It is incumbent upon us to consider
now only the first of these. At the
beginning of modern artistic music (not the
music of the people, the folk songs) we find
the Gregorian chant, a musically formless
droning of the church liturgy, in which the
only rhythm was that of the text, and the
melody was the outgrowth of mere intonation.
The cultivators of artistic music were
the monks, who found as material ready to
hand only the folk songs of the people and
the music of the Greeks. The latter appealed
to these cloistered mediæval scholars
as the only proper material for churchly
use, and they set to work to develop a
system. It was inevitable that modern
scientific music should begin with the invention
of the <i>materia musicæ</i>. These old
monks had first to develop melody, and it
was natural that having once started upon
that labor they should carry it out to its
logical issue. Melodic form is more obvious
than harmonic, hence they developed
it. Having once got the melodic idea
firmly fixed in their minds, they conceived
a composition to be a combination of
melodies, and when at some period about
the end of the eleventh century the device
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
of imitating in a second voice the melody
uttered by the first was invented, counterpoint,
single and double, grew with great
rapidity."</p>

<p>In their exploration of the possibilities
of melodic combinations, Okeghem, Des
Prés, and their successors laid down the
primary laws of music and consequently
established the first forms, for in music
form is the first manifestation of law. The
first of all musical forms was that found
in the songs of the people in which the
rhythmic dependence of the music upon
the text was the controlling principle. But
the earliest scientific composers, the monks
and church writers, having only the liturgy
in mind, ignored the folk songs and so
robbed themselves of the aid of the simple
rhythmic forms dependent upon verse.
They naturally could not avail themselves
of these forms because the liturgy was not
written in verse.</p>

<p>Having, therefore, nothing to serve as
a model, they were obliged to start from the
foundation and build a wholly new musical
system. Thus they produced, in a series
of developments occupying nearly 700
years, the most closely knit and purely intellectual
group of musical forms, those
classed as canonic or fugal. Hence we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
that the first of the three great periods of
musical history, the Polyphonic, is chiefly
distinguished by intellectual characteristics,
because, as I have said, the evolution of
form is in the main an intellectual process.</p>

<p>But even the canonic forms were modified
by the irrepressible spirit of romanticism.
Whenever in the history of music the desire
to express one's self has acted upon a man
of original mind it has caused a change in
forms. The first period of the Netherlands
school, for example, was devoted to the
formulation of musical science. In the
second period came Josquin des Prés, whose
desire for pure beauty in music led him to
modify the forms left him by Okeghem.
In the third period, as we have seen, Willaert
and others still further modified forms
and introduced the element of tone-painting.
In the fourth period we find Lasso again
modifying forms and introducing the element
of pure emotional expression, which,
in so far as unaccompanied church music is
concerned, was perfected by his great contemporary,
Palestrina. In later periods we
find that Haydn laid the foundations of the
sonata, Mozart of the concerto and genuine
opera, Beethoven changed the whole trend
and scope of the symphony, Chopin, Schumann
and Liszt remodelled the diction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
the technics of the piano, and Wagner produced
an absolutely new operatic form.
These are only a few instances. This book
is made up of the accounts of these and
others.</p>

<p>Every original genius in music, then, has
something to alter existing forms. Why?
Because he could not say exactly what he
wished in the forms as he found them.
Classicism, in its old sense always resisted
just such movements. Original geniuses
are not numerous. One makes or changes
a form. The mechanical workers (often
mistaken for geniuses) take the forms left
by the geniuses and use them. The impression
spreads that the form is the essential
thing, and he who does not strictly
adhere to it is condemned. An era of formalism
usually follows any great improvement
made in form by an original mind. This
continues till another original mind makes a
new departure, which is accomplished always
in the face of opposition. This opposition
is not wholly wrong, for it must be
proved that a man is a genius before it can
be admitted that he has a right to offer a
new form to the world. It may be that his
genius is purely technical, as in the case of
Liszt, or wholly spiritual, as in the case of
Schumann, but there must be something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
convincing in the man and his work. A
small mind which has nothing to offer cannot
justify an alteration of accepted forms.</p>

<p>The contest between classicism and romanticism,
now at an end, since classicism
simply means devotion to pure beauty of
form and matter, is exhibited throughout
the three great periods of musical history.
The Polyphonic period may be regarded as
extending from the beginning of the French
school, 1100 <span class="smcap-all">A. D.</span>, to the death of Bach,
1750. This, as the reader will see, includes
the transfer of the technics of polyphonic
writing from vocal to instrumental music.
The classic period, that in which the great
works in the sonata form were produced,
extends from the production of Haydn's
first symphony, 1754, to the production
of Beethoven's "Eroica" symphony in
1804. Then came a transition period, during
which the romantic element in music
was pushed to the front by the "Eroica" and
the fifth, sixth, and seventh of Beethoven's
symphonies. In 1821 Weber's "Der Freischütz"
was produced, and Schubert's "Der
Erl-König" was first sung in public. From
that time the romantic school in music has
been dominant.</p>

<p>The chief value of the study of musical
history to the music lover is the acquisition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
of a correct point of view, and it is to aid in
that acquisition by the reader of this book
that I have written these observations upon
the characters and purposes of the three
great periods. In listening to the music of
any composer the hearer should take into
account the general tendency, purpose, and
scope of musical art of his period and also
the particular aims of the composer. No
one has a right to say that Mozart failed
because he did not achieve what Beethoven
did. Mozart accomplished all that could be
accomplished with the resources of musical
art in his day, and he himself enormously
enlarged those resources. That is the
achievement of a genius. Every one has a
right to say that Donizetti and Bellini failed
because they not only did not succeed in
accomplishing all that it was possible to accomplish
in opera in their time, but deliberately
ignored the fundamental principles of
the art and also the immense advances in its
technic made by Gluck and Mozart. Every
one must admit that Verdi has achieved
the triumph of a great master in his "Falstaff,"
for he has utilized everything contributed
to operatic art by its leading geniuses,
old and new, and yet has produced an entirely
original and independent work. In conclusion,
therefore, let me call the attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
of the reader to the salient characteristics of
the three periods.</p>

<p>The Polyphonic, because of its labors
in developing the most rigid of forms, is
chiefly notable for its intellectual characteristics.
It displays immense mastery of the
elementary materials of music and an enormous
profundity of thought in purely technical
processes. As it advances one sees it
gradually developing beauty of style, and
finally, from a state in which it is impossible
to discover any emotion at all,
it advances to one in which there is the
purest and most beautiful embodiment of
the devotional, contemplative spirit of the
religious life of its time. It is the religious
life that is withdrawn from the world, not
that which is spent among men. For the
embodiment of the latter life one must turn
to the music of German Protestantism
and study the works of Bach. Thus we
find that Polyphonic music finds its expressive
field in religion, just as did Gothic
architecture, to which it so closely corresponds.
There is no use of seeking in this
music for the note of earthly passion. For
that you must go to the opera, and later to
the symphony.</p>

<p>The Classic period was the period of pure
beauty in instrumental music. It corresponds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
to the second and third periods of the
Netherlands school, and existed for the same
reasons, namely, that its formal materials
had been developed just far enough to permit
its composers to make beautiful effects
without aiming at an organized system of
expression. In the Classic period we find
wonderful symmetry of form, a continual
subordination of profound learning to a
pleasing style, and a sweetness and serenity
of the emotional atmosphere. In Haydn
and Mozart we find simple and tuneful
subjects and bright, good-natured, and perspicuous
treatment. In the sonatas and
symphonies of the Classic period one finds
no attempt at the expression of anything
deeper than sentiment. The note of passion
was attempted only in opera, but it was
never permitted even there to create a
serious disturbance of pure musical beauty.</p>

<p>The Romantic period took its spirit from
the romantic movement in German poetry.
In it one finds a constant struggle for the
definite expression of the profoundest emotions
of our nature. Its forms are flexible,
its diction the richest attainable, and its conception
of beauty based largely on its ideal
of truth. It is in this period that music now
is, but it does not follow that no contemporaneous
composer has a right to offer us a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
work in the classic form and style. We must
accept it as an example of pure musical
beauty, and not look for an expressiveness
which the composer did not seek to attain.
The tendency of composers of absolute
music at present is to make less and less use
of the strict classic forms. But there are
certain fundamental principles of music which
they cannot ignore without danger to the art.
The music lover who has an understanding
of the spirit of musical history will best be able
to appreciate their purposes and their achievements,
without losing the power to enjoy the
less pretentious works of the fathers of modern
music.</p>
